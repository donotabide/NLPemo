I wish I could go back in time and protect myself from the pain, trauma, and abuse I ended up experiencing from my ex-gf as well as my ex-best friend. Even though I try to remind myself that it isn't shameful to be caring and empathetic, I nonetheless feel so much regret, shame, and disappointment, and I am haunted every day by PTSD from betrayal, assault, and heartbreak. Although I feel some measure of pride and relief that I am the type of person to take ownership of my mistakes and learn from them, I am disgusted and terrified for the people they interact with, because they definitely aren't. Personally, I'm exhausted by other people's bullshit. I disapprove of doubting people by default, but definitely, if someone is actually showing conflicting signals, even if it's subtle, please listen to your instincts and drop/drift away from the person ASAP to save yourself some heartache. Like yes, no one is wholly good or bad, but there's a distinct line beteeen character quirks / weaknesses and flaws that tend to result in abusive, toxic, and/or invalidating behavior. I'm still trying to be cognizant of this myself so that I'm not too forgiving in the future. P.S. I'm going to give one identifying demographic - I'm female. Just to bring attention to the queer community and so that people don't automatically assume I'm male because I mention an ex-gf. But yeah. Abuse and sexual harassment / assault happen between two women as well (and naturally, between other genders too).

Hello does anyone here suffer from depersonalization/ derealisation? Basically it is the feeling of disconnect from yourself and other and reality. Like watching a movie of yourself. People usually have similar feelings when high or drunk. From what I hear people usually get it from lack of social interaction/ being alone. I just got this a few weeks ago and it is the scariest thing ever. I look into the mirror and my family members and don't recognize them. It has made my stress levels and anxiety to skyrocket past what they already are and made it hard to eat and i am losing a lot of weight. Ive never though of myself as antisocial but I stopped socializing to many people so I could just focus on my schoolwork about a year ago. I got better grades and was eating better but now this happened and im scared to death. When I talk to people it gets slightly better but I dont know anyone well enough to have long conversations with over many days.(basically a friend). Would anyone out there who has or does not have this be willing to talk to me/ get lunch for a while or let me join there friend group to help me break out of this?(basically do friend things and talk and stuff) Im not one to write stuff like this but I am very scared and alone right now and I have no one else to turn to. Hopefully some bruins out there can help out a fellow bruin. And only comment if you want to actually help me because I really need help.

I love UCLA, I really do, But sometimes I feel like the heavy workload and the stress of being a premed has sucked all my individuality out of me. It's like I have lost the core parts of my identity because I spend so much of my energy just trying to stay afloat. I guess that's why I love North Campus majors so much. They have the passion and charisma that I and so many others around me have lost.

I wonder everyday if I am worth living. I knew I was a piece of shit. I have shitty personality, I am not smart, I am not good looking, and I am not a great person at all. Coming to college, I knew making friends would be hard and I knew especially someone with my shitty personality, I knew I wasnt going to make friends. It hurts though. I don't want to kill myself because I want to believe life will get better. I feel lonely, lost, betrayed, and unmotivated. I feel angry at myself because I cant grow faster enough to be a better individual.I also drown my thoughts by getting busy but that makes me fell worse. I also don't want to share this to my parents because they will worry and I don't want to share to my friends because my mental health problem seems so small. Does anyone know what to do?

To my fellow bruins suffering with depression and mental illnesses. Things will get better Let me tell you this is the biggest lie in the history of lies. People tell me this all the time--when I'm having suicidal thoughts, after a suicide attempt, and even when I'm strapped to a hospital bed. They've told me this after they learned how I was destroyed as a child by other people. They are wrong. Things are the same. What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to just forget about it. (what an ignorant idiot they are)) But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

I totally feel undocumented immigrants because I was badly treated once with the consideration that myself is undocumented. My fucking ------ roommate who mentioned something about deportation to me. She is a crazy bitch and mentioned about deportation. I left the place with penalty because I did not want to live there with the devil. Even though I receive financial aid, it does not mean that I am an undocumented. Also, even if I was DACA, my immigration status shouldn't be blackmailed.

I was dismissed from UCLA recently, and I feel like a part of me has died inside. I still pretend like everything is ok and when friends and family ask me about class I make up all of these elaborate lies. But the truth is I have nowhere to go. I fucked up to the point of no return. And I don't blame anyone or anything but myself. I brought this on myself. I just want everyone reading this to know that if you or someone you know is going through shit and its affecting your grades seek help NOW. Don't sit and ignore it like I did. Pls keep fighting. I promise to also seek help and fight as well. I wish us the best of luck. Love you <3

To the De Neve worker who has every right to be kinda pissed rn -- I swear I didn't look you in the eye and leave my plates for you to clear!! I was just gonna get a churro before I came back to take all my plates and go ): I feel so bad ily im sorry if you think im THAT PERSON that leaves all my playes on the table and goes i promise im not

I am suicidal since I got major depression and anhedonia from LSD/MDMA combo 2 months back. Ive been going to therapy and its useless. They do mindfulness acceptance exercises but its all pointless. The fact is--and I told my therapist this--that unless this resolves in another month or two im out of here and will just kill myself. I dont give any fucks about mindful this or mindful that or CBT this or CBT that. One fact is I will NOT and I REFUSE to deal with a mental health condition i did not have before. If I cannot live my life the way I did before the mental condition, then i will not live my life. I will say bye to all my friends and family and it will be a sad tragedy but tbh there is no point in living with this condition anyways. And Meds dont work either. I had a pretty bright future as an engineering major but no more. I will not be tolerating this much longer especially given that therapy isnt curing me. Therapy is actually making me more suicidal by giving me dumb mindfulness exercises. The fact is therapy does not cure this and if I do not get cured then i see no point in living. I had 0% anhedonia before and for me even a drop of anhedonia is too much anhedonia. Mathematically, that is infinitely more than before and thus unacceptable and I will just kill myself. Anyways--I still have some hope. Has anybody done any rapid antidepressant therapy to get rid of all the symptoms such as ECT (electroconvulsion therapy)? Im scared of memory loss but hey its better than suicide right? #uclasecretsmentalhealth

Does anyone else ever feel like you have a bunch of acquaintances, but nobody really wants to spend much time with you aside from a hello, maybe even a quick hug? Close relationships have always been hard to come by for me.I think I'm a decent person--that I'm generally kind, compassionate, and sensitive to the needs and emotions of others. Sometimes I even feel like I am a bit of an old soul in a sense because I am mature beyond my years in some ways even though I still have a slightly dirty sense of humor. Not to mention romantic relationships. I have never had a boyfriend and I am a couple of years older than most college seniors.I'm not extraordinarily gorgeous but I also think I am not terribly bad looking. Sometimes I feel like people don't like me, and I tell myself that it's just all in my head or I just haven't given them a chance to like me because I keep to myself too much. But other times I think it's true, that people really don't see much value in being my friend/don't like me. I think it's normal for everyone to have people that don't like them. But when does it reach the point at which so many people don't like you that there must be something wrong with you? That people never respond to your texts or emails--because they don't like you or because they're busy? Surely if you were somewhat important to them they would answer at some point. I guess what I'm trying to say is: How many people that don't like you does it take to prove that you're just not likable? Like maybe if it's a small group--maybe 5 people- that doesn't like you, then surely it's on them for not liking you--there's nothing wrong with you/your personality/your characteristics. But if a huge number of people dislike you, then doesn't that say something about you, not them? I know getting people to like you should never be the goal in life, but if none of your peers like you, if you have no friends--what to do? I often feel that I can go the whole day at school without speaking to anyone except maybe a few words. Maybe that's why I talk so much at home...  #uclasecretsfriends

I am an Econ major and I hate it. My parents pretty much forced me into this major. Whenever I tell them I want to change my major, they always threaten they will stop paying tuition for me. For some reason, they think Econ is about trading stocks and analyzing its graphs. In reality, it is very theoretical and Math intensive. All the models are based on unrealistic assumptions. I hope I don't fall apart before I graduate.  #uclasecretsannoying

I am a former bruin, Asian female, who is currently going to law school in a southern state. I really miss how inclusive UCLA was. Here, I often face subtle discrimination which just feels normal now. Two times in the beginning of this semester when I spoke in one of my small class, the professor very subtly ignored me and moved on. She acted as if she was responding to me but she actually talked about something completely different that I was very confused. Second time when it happened, she later addressed what I said during the class without addressing me, and criticized what I said (in a way saying such thing) and it was very apparent to other people that she was criticizing my action. Also, even though she encourages students who normally don't volunteer in the class to speak more, she ignores when I raise my hand and calls everyone else who usually dominates the class. That happened twice and I stopped bothering to raise my hand. Recently, I submitted a research summary about a topic that I am interested in for my final research paper, and she sent me an email saying I sound so knowledgeable and she is wondering if I already know a lot about the topic. It is very frustrating how my good faith effort in researching and putting time in choosing the topic is just going to be interpreted that way by the professor who is going to grade my work. I replied with the sources I used and told her that I do not actually know a lot but did not hear any response yet. It is frustrating because every other students think she is a very nice person and would not think that she is doing this. She was also very nice to me when I was in her office hour that I cannot tell if she does this intentionally/consciously. Last year, my Asian friend who was in her class experienced the same situation and reported her to three different officials at school but no one was willing to take an action. The student affairs dean told my friend that it will only put her at disadvantage and do nothing to the professor if she were to seek further action. I will probably go to the professor's office hour tomorrow to address her email and my research paper in general. Any suggestion on how I should talk during the office hour?  #uclasecretsquestion

So I got introduced to this girl while I was studying and she is just so adorable. The things she say and the dumb snaps I get from her make me want to just squeeze her. I would love to take her on a mini-golf date, and go get gelato afterwards :p  #uclasecretscrush

There was this cute boy with glasses sitting across from me in the Kerckhoff upstairs area today and I was dealing with a ton work and could not address the fact that I thought he was cute but shout out to you because you're a cutie and somebody should let you know <3 (11/06) #uclasecretscrush

To the guy who had the crush on the girl for 4 years but graduated: text her, ask her how shes doing, catch up? Who said long distance wasn't worth a shot? #uclasecretsrelationships

I have a friend who got dumped by a guy she liked over the summer and I'm really worried about her. She was getting over him at the beginning but she recently found out some gossip about him having a new girl now and that put her back at square zero. When you ask her about it she says that she is ok but she's really not. Something about her has changed and she's become obsessed about her weight. She's lost about 20 lbs and keeps talking about wanting to lose 20 more but she will be really thin then. She hasn't been eating much either and she used to love eating. I'm worried to the point where I've come close to messaging the guy and asking him to talk to her.

One thing that I'm too afraid to tell anyone is that my older brother took advantage of me growing up so now I've got commitment issues and trust issues. It just has a taken a great toll on me.. and I'm talking to someone but I don't think it will last bc I broke up with the last guy I really loved bc of my depression and whatnot. Which makes me even sadder hahhaha.. I try to laugh it off..

My roommate does not go out... at all. He does not talk either. Literally he stays in our room all day after class, even to-go his lunches from b cafe or somewhere and eat in here. Floormates don't know who he is either. Im kinda getting tired of him being antisocial.

Confession time: I don't think I've ever had a real crush/romantic interest in anyone. Doesn't really help that it took me a long time to understand what makes a person attractive, and that a person can be attractIVE to me without me being attractED. BUT I think I may have found both in this one person, at least in the aesthetic attractiveness and being attracted to the personality. I THINK. But I'm not sure? And we aren't like super close, but we've recently become better friends, and I can see myself having more romantic inclinations eventually? They are a genuinely good person, and I don't think I am giving them a halo effect. I don't know, IS THIS WHAT HAVING A CRUSH IS LIKE???

I swearrr you guys need to stop partying on the open area at the apartment near Strathmore and Levering every damn Thursday with loud music on until 3-4 am! At least get an closed area.... Y'all selfish little bastards. Can y'all just leave us in peace with the little sleep that we're getting during midterm weeks? Grow up with your lame parties I swearr! I'm calling the police. urggg

It's funny how all the guys I talk to think that all we girls want is to have sex with them... like I just wanna talk to be friends with you. Not to be a one night stand. Not even that, but at least have more than 1 conversation with me before you ask if I'm DTF. Honestly. wtf.

Why do I feel lonely even when I'm surrounded by people I love and who love me back? I'm not even sure what will satisfy me at this point. It's really rough being in an environment of constant affirmation while feeling like I'm missing out by not having a deeper connection to someone special. It's not that I'm ungrateful for everyone and everything that's good to me. I really don't think I am. I just don't know what exactly would help me feel better. All I know is that I don't have whatever that is yet.

During my freshman year I was incredibly lonely. I ate at the dining halls by myself, I didn't talk to anyone on my floor, and I never went out on the weekends or even on my birthday. I knew it was my fault for being so shy, but I always felt like I was doing college wrong because everyone else was going out and having so much fun. Things are better for me now, but I still remember what it was like to be that lonely, so whenever I recognize an acquaintance sitting by themselves in lecture, I try to sit with them, even if I have other friends in the class. Especially if they're transfer students, since I know that makes it so much harder. I know it's easy to feel lonely in a place like UCLA, but that's going to keep happening if we don't open ourselves to new people. If you have a clique or friend group, consider opening it up to a stranger that you like. Or if you want to get to know a classmate better, have you and your friends sit with them in lecture. You could be saving someone's life, or at the very least make someone's day. And even if they actually want to be alone and you're bothering them, they'll make it clear, and you can just brush it off and go back to the comfort of your friends. I'm a shy introvert and I hate talking to people, but I also hate the idea of someone feeling like they don't belong due to loneliness.

To all the freshmen/second years/ any-years thinking about how hard it is to make friends in college compared to high school: think about how you spent 8 hours a day at high school. Of course its easier to make friends with all the people stuck there w you for such a long time everyday!! My best advice is to join a club or team for something you really enjoy. I met some of my best friends when I joined a dance team!

Anyone else feel like they have a few friends but don't have anyone close? I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to like deep conversation wise Or even hangout on the weekend. Mainly Like 15min convos. Guess I have no real friends huh Just wanted to express myself anonymously since I can't really tell anyone how I feel. And no I don't think I'm depressed

I had a huge crush on one very special girl for the entirety of my four years at UCLA. We were friends but I knew I didn't stand a chance so I did nothing. I wasn't able to fall for another person and I thought it was because she was still around or at least physically close enough in my life. Now that I graduated and moved to another place I realized I have truly lost the ability to love.

My girlfriend recently broke up with me because she feels she needs more time to take care of herself and apparently I must have been doing something wrong because she went from telling me how I was the only guy who made her feel this way to leaving me. I am doing relatively ok now, but I feel hurt, I just wish people would say what they mean and when they make a commitment stick with it. I want her to do this if this is the best thing for her, but it seems like she should have known earlier. I am thinking this may not be a juicy enough secret to get posted, but this girl meant so much to me, the only girl I have wanted for all of 2017 and my heart breaks because I feel like we went from being great friends to her being upset at me when I did nothing. It is too bad that she will never know the full extent of what she meant to me, she saved my life several times. If she somehow ever sees this I want her to know I am not mad, just sad at how everything ended.

I'm taking a class with a really young professor (he's 31) and I've developed the hugest crush on him. I'm 24 and I haven't even had a crush on anyone since I was like, 17. He's exactly the kind of guy I would have asked out if we'd met in a different setting. Now I'm wondering, once the quarter is over and the grades are posted, would it be appropriate for me to ask him out?? Or would he think I'm a complete idiot? I like him so much it's ridiculous...

Don't know if it's the American culture - it seems a very big deal when you talk to an opposite sex. This is the convo happened between me and a friend the other day. me: Hey what's you up to :) guy: You keep talking to me. I'm not into dating you though, sorry. I felt so attacked. I genuinely care about people it's not a matter of romantic or not romantic. When we were children, we can hit each other up, go to the park and not worry about things like this. Wish people could let loose & not make everything about dating.

I'm honestly surprised after what happened in Las Vegas and the extent of that horrific tragedy, nothing happened at all afterwards except lower morale. No changes to policies or laws, not even a well-known, national public discussion as for ways to prevent future mass murders. Gun control (stricter or more relaxed) shouldn't be the only issue of discussion here. Mental health is another. Psychology third. We should be understanding the thought processes behind these murderers and why they believe in killing. We should be looking for ways to dispel that wicked and demented belief at every opportunity. Take a look at today (November 5th) in Texas. 25+ more innocent lives gone. Millions more will have to go to their Sunday services or other places of worship with the unnecessary fear of being attacked. Security will be tightened, our freedoms possibly further restricted, and the process repeats itself again unfortunately. How much longer do we have to go through this before someone finally calls for a public debate in looking for legislative answers to mass murders?

I just really want to be friends with this person that's pretty reserved. They have a close group of friends partly bc they play a sport and so they're with each other 24/7. However, this person is the one who reached out and seemed to have wanted to be friends in the first place. Yet now they don't ever reach out or really communicate and I'm not sure if I'm being annoying by trying to talk to them. I really do want to be friends you seem like a cool person!!! I guess I'll be just around if you want to hang  #uclasecretsfriends

My internship supervisor just rejected being a recommender although she praised my work during the internship. Now I don't know what to do. It is so hard to keep hope in life when you lose sth. that you thought you got it. #uclasecretsconfessions #uclasecretshope

Honestly since coming to college, I've really stopped feeling any emotions. Bottling up my emotions has been a way of coping with the stressors of life but it's reached a point where its not healthy. No one knows I'm hurting, no one knows I'm stressed and sometimes I don't even know if I'm hurting or stressed. There's not a lot of things that trigger an emotional response such as happiness or sadness. I almost got jumped and I didn't even feel a thing. My emotions are neutral but I have rbf so everyone thinks I'm mad or angry. They tell me to smile more but I can't smile if I don't really feel anything. I can still empathize with people but its difficult to express my own emotions or even know if I am feeling anything. This stoicism makes it hard to connect with people because I either come off as cold and unfeeling or an arrogant asshole. Thoughts? #uclasecretsemotions #uclasecretsstress

Random question, but I don't know where else to ask it - has anyone else noticed a trend of memes that are videos but could easily be images? As in they're just images with a very subtle special effect going on in the background? What are they trying to do, use up all our data? #uclasecretsmemes

I ate alone a ridiculous amount of times the past two years and it is great because you don't have to force conversation while simultaneously chewing food, you get some time alone to yourself at this insanely crowded school, and you can go at your own pace and leave whenever you want to and not have to deal with planning out when/where to meet with flaky college people. Ya'll need to learn how to be ok being alone, jesus.  #uclasecretsalone #uclasecretspreference

'If you're no good in bed, there's nothing good about you. You're not smart, you're not good looking. Honestly, why am I still with you?' Do not pressure us into things if we do not want to. Especially if we said so before. I lost my virginity 5 years ago, and the stigma is that guys can't be raped. Well, trust me. I definitely didn't enjoy it, and it affects my relationships to this day. Coerced consent isn't consent, no means no, and consent is revocable. #MeToo #uclasecretsconsent #uclasecretsconfession

My friend from high school just started school at UCLA this year. During first week, we were hanging out pretty much every day and I felt like we were getting really close. I even began to develop feelings for her. But she just suddenly stopped hanging out with me and I'm not sure why. Every time I asked her to go to dinner or just study together, she would turn me down. I've been feeling pretty depressed about it and it seems like she just doesn't think I'm fun to be around anymore. I talked to her about it on Facebook (I wanted to in person, but she always makes excuses to not meet up), but she just acts like nothing is wrong, when clearly something has changed. I don't know what I should do. I really care about her, but it doesn't seem like she has the same feelings toward me. #uclasecretsfriend #uclasecretschange

someone very close to me died recently and anytime i hear words to do with death or dying or even when someone makes a joke about wanting to die im immediately triggered and can't get it out of my mind.. i feel like this is going to be on my mind all year and i really need help but I don't know where to start :( i am not ok  #uclasecretstrigger #uclasecretsdeath

I have lingering PTSD from years of abuse that my friends don't know about. Because of this, sometimes I react in unexpected ways at their behavior, then they laugh at it or jokingly chastise me for it. I know they mean well and it's not their fault, but it still makes me feel a little hurt, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't want them to feel hyperconscious or bad about it either :/ #uclasecretsfriends #uclasecretsconfessions

This is my first year, and I still haven't made friends. Everyone told me over the summer: become BFFs with your roommates, join clubs, make study groups, talk to your floormates, chill with your professors... But my roommates hang out with their high school friends, I don't know anyone in the clubs I go to or my classes, I somehow live on the most antisocial floor on campus, and there's a giant-ass crowd at the end of every class to even talk to my professors. Every time I text someone I barely met, they either ghost me or it turns out they already have plans with their real friends, and I only feel more and more like an annoying acquaintance they're tired of dealing with. I don't think I'll ever have friends like I did in high school, and I'm terrified of being the only loner in what seems to be a truly social campus. #uclasecretsfriends

Recently, I've been having to tell myself to not make permanent decisions based on hopefully temporary feelings. I've been having to tell that to myself every single day lately. The only reason why I haven't done it is because of my parents. Other than that, I don't care anymore.  #uclasecretsthoughts

He claimed that he wanted to talk to me about a club he was in. I obliged to a dinner at a dining hall. He was a true conversationalist, but he was bitter. He had hatred in the way he talked about humans, and he was hung up about the past. Somehow we ended up in my floor's lounge, and he started making moves on me. He slid his hand down my leg. I didn't do anything. I was shocked. At that point I was naive and did not know to put my guard up around guys. I just wanted to talk. He manipulated me into my room. We had sex. I didn't want to. This began two surreal months, as I continued to sleep with my abuser and I became more and more depressed and stuck in an abusive spiral. He was obsessed with a past girl that he had slept with. She had a boyfriend then. He probably manipulated her too. He would talk about how she was the one, how she was his soulmate, and I would listen. He claimed she was still into him. I don't know why I did, but I tried hard to empathize with him as I hurt inside. He put me down, he belittled my abilities, my opinions, and idealist tendencies. He had delusions of grandeur. He was going to be one of the greats, he would leave a legacy on humanity. He thought everyone was stupid. He once flashed and held a pocket knife against throat as I struggled against him. It was just a joke. I finally broke in the end. I told him I can't do this anymore. He didn't say anything. He raped me again that night. #metoo #uclasecretsrape

People told me to think my recent relationship as a good experience and learn from it. It is true and I should, but I cannot stop wishing I never met the person. All of the memories I can remember are painful and sorrowful. I get angry on how I was treated and to think how much the person is enjoying life. You know, I should've never met you. I don't need the memories, just get away from my life please. I told you I am happy that I met you - sorry now to think of it without the love I once had, you were just a very very bad person in my life.  #uclasecretsmemories #uclasecretsrelationships

Being an underachiever, I can't tell how much the Simpsons episode 'Bart Gets An F' gets to me whenever I watch it. Studying all night and stocked on adderall in a ridiculously competitive class, I go to the final thinking that I'm going to ace it and this is literally the very best that I can do, that I cannot top this performance. Maybe my parents will understand that. I come out of the final and feel satisfied about it, and am pretty happy I got done with it after all this hardwork. Then I get to when the results are announced, in a week or two. I barely come near an 80 and with the curve I'm lucky so I get a B-. What do I say? What did I do wrong? I did everything I could, but here I am. Interviewers will look at this and spout the usual but if you're really interested in the material, it would show in your grades or at least make that face when they see your GPA. Is it my poor attention? I'm not sure, but when things like this keep subtly telling you that you're disappointing, it starts to get to you. I never got close to a 3.5, heck even a 3.2. IFYP Bart

I seek solace in reading success stories of people who had rough circumstances but managed to be really successful in the end. I do this because I graduated with a 2.5 GPA & no internships from UCLA and I occasionally I have that depressing day when all I could think about are all the opportunities that are lost and can no longer pursue (grad school....). I made my mistakes back in the day, but today, I am much more mature and I have come to learn that the true recipe to any form of success is self-discipline. A combination of lack of discipline and having no clue what future I wanted for myself is what put me into this mess. Don't be like me and screw up, because you'll certainly run into roadblocks and work much harder in the end (and have depressing days like me today lol). Study, even if you don't feel like it; go workout, even if you don't feel like it; go to office hours, even if you don't feel like it. It's ALWAYS going to be a battle between that voice inside your head saying, I can do it later, and you, the TRUE decision maker. Try to think of that voice in your head as if it was someone else trying to tell you what to do and doing the complete opposite because you ain't no lil bitch and nobody is going to tell you what to do but you lol. Reaching a true level self-discipline means being able to ignore that voice in your head that is constantly saying maybe later and instead getting to work and putting in 200% of your effort into it, even if you feel like utter crap doing it. Forget about motivation too--motivation is fleeting and fickle, discipline is dependable and reliable. Finally, although not completely related, but here's my favorite quote for the past few weeks: “It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” (stop fkn caring what other people think of you and do whatever makes you feel confident and great...but also never forget to always be nice to other people haha) uclasecretsthoughts

Can anyone give me some advice: I am a 4th year MIMG major with a 3.0GPA. I've always wanted to become a doctor. I used to be a great student until I came to UCLA. I used to know how to manage time, I used to know how to get great test scores.. And now I am empty because I feel that I am a different person. I feel I have no way of getting into med school with my 3.0 GPA while fellow classmates have 3.8's with stellar MCAT scores applying. All I have are a few volunteering experiences and 3 years of experience working as an employee in Reagan MC. I haven't even taken MCATS because I feel like I won't even qualify, and it will set me back about $5-10k for med school expenses to end up not getting accepted. Any advice, comments, experiences welcome #uclasecretsadvice

I mentally buried and justified my molester for over ten years because I didn't want to believe that I was a person who could be repeatedly molested. Hey, maybe he was just tickling me. Well, it's not as bad as rape, so I can't tell anyone about it. I'm sure he didn't mean any harm, right? Now I'm suffering the effects of those justifications as I try to piece together my memories and move on.  #uclasecretssupport

When do people usually meet their best friends or even friends in college? I'm also a second year and still haven't met mine and I feel like my loneliness is affecting my mental health a lot. #uclasecretslonely

Last Thanksgiving my cousin's new wife, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white girl called me and the rest of my Mexican family racist cuz we said white privilege exists. It takes a lot of white privilege to be white and call minorities racist. #cringegiving.

I had a lovely Thanksgiving with my family until my mom brought up how Die Hard was her favorite Christmas movie. We spent literally an hour and a half in an argument over whether or not it is a holiday movie (it totally is), which ended in my family and I storming out of my cousin's house. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! #CringeGiving.

To the well-dressed boy who approached me at the edge of Washington Square Park on November 6th: I've never had anyone run after me just to politely introduce themselves, tell me they noticed me walking through the park, and that I looked pretty — that might just be one of the sweetest encounters with a stranger I've ever had. I was actually having an overwhelmingly stressful day, and your thoughtful gesture really cheered me up! I greatly admire your courage (bolder than anything I could ever manage) and appreciate how courteous you were throughout our short conversation. Usually the type of guy to approach me is a serious creep, an asian fetishist, or someone who makes me feel unsafe walking around at night, so it was incredibly refreshing to meet someone so genuine and endearing. As I mentioned (and I hope you didn't think I was lying to try to get out of anything), I do have a boyfriend of 4 years, and didn't feel it was appropriate to give you my number or stay in contact in any way. But I just felt horrible for leaving so suddenly (I was flustered and thought it was a prank/dare!) and wanted to get this message to you somehow. You seemed like a stellar guy and, objectively, you are also super good looking! Your next girlfriend found a keeper! Wishing you the best.

Guess our professor forgot about daylight savings, cuz he took a look at his watch at 1 and said all right, looks like we're out of time! (class ends at 2) The entire class just looked at each other with that do we tell him look, then we all got up and left and honestly I've never felt this level of community at NYU ever before.

can someone please explain what purpose nyu's multi factor authentication is supposed to serve besides being really frustrating.

Went to the doctor today and apparently I have all of the symptoms (obvious and messed known) of being pregnant. Waiting for the bloodwork. Checked recently about my thyroid so that's not the issue. I feel like I should be freaking out because it's literally impossible for me to be pregnant but honestly I'm more excited to see how much it would freak a bunch of racists out to find out that Jesus came from an Asian.

Last weekend, I hosted a halloween party, when friends went into my room to get something, found my American Whopper dildo instead, brought it outside into the living room and started tossing it around. By the end of the night, people were using it as microphones, trying to get the suction end to stick on the ceiling, and covering it in glitter makeup. It was all fine, until the next day, I noticed it was gone. My roommates and I turned our entire apartment upside down, and we still couldn't find it. it's been a week now, and we still have no idea where it is. Tl;dr Somebody stole my dildo, and I have no idea what to do with my life now.

I like when my boyfriend calls me mommy in bed. Makes me feel like I'm finally the one in control... is that something I should be ashamed of? Like it's not about my mom or anything, just a feeling i get, you know?

My freshman year roommate was such an extreme nudist. Always naked, dong in your face. He even used to jerk off with the door open. Like welcome to fucking NYU.

I think I have a crush on one of Andrew Hamilton's bodyguards.I keep running into him on campus and at events. I particularly find the one with black hair kind of cute, and I keep seeing him around but I never get a chance to strike up a conversation with him that lasts for longer than 30 seconds. I didn't even get to ask for his name. Please help a girl out, im just tryna find love

I'm afraid to come out to my parents because I'm worried they'd stop paying my tuition just because I'm gay.

As a man, I have been sexually assaulted by a woman in the past. I have wanted to join the #MeToo movement for some time now, but I'm afraid I'll be ridiculed or berated. Every time I have told a friend about my experience I have always been told “It's not a big deal, she was probably just messing around” or “well if she was hot, then why is it a problem?” Sexual assault is sexual assault, and I should be able to come clean about my experiences without being told they're not real.

Running 2 hours past the “incident” in Lower Manhattan and still haven't received any text from NYU. You ghosting us, Public Safety?

Me: I'm a strong independent woman and no man can ever make me feel small. Also me: Choke me harder. (This secret was brought to you by daddy issues)

Growing up, my parents at best, were emotionally neglectful and at worst, emotionally abusive. Since then, I've been forced to fend for myself in terms of providing myself emotional and mental support. I'm thankful they're paying for my college education but I sometimes wish they weren't. Aside from supporting me financially, which I greatly appreciate and am so thankful for, they constantly berate me, are condescending, and blame me for things that aren't my fault. I wish I could cut them off, but I know that I can't. Is it bad I'm sticking around just for the free tuition?

If you have a laptop don't sit in a seat with a computer in the library just to use the laptop instead. My broke ass family can't afford me a laptop and the desktops are EVERYTHING at school.

I hate my body. It faces a wage gap, underrepresentation in corporate boardrooms and poliitics, and stigma in society. Little kids watch Disney movies grow up learning that main characters don't look like me. Adults watch movies learning that, too. I was going to specify which trait I'm talking about, but it doesn't matter. Just know there's a whole underbelly of isms that aren't talked about or stigmatized, but still damage lives.

Sometimes when I'm in Bobst I'll pretend I have to take a call or something just so I can talk to the cute girl next to me and ask her to watch my stuff for a few minutes. Anything to break the ice right?

Tonight, I'm going out and am playing a drinking game - take a shot for every Pickle Rick, sexy Pennywise, or Wonder Woman I see. Let's hope I don't die. Happy Halloween, fam!

I read the secret about the Comic Sans font and literally felt stabbed in my heart. This makes me feel like I care too much about aesthetic and reminded me of this: I broke up with my last boyfriend because I met him during the winter but summer came around and he started wearing cargo shorts. I literally felt less attracted to him and couldn't continue on. I feel like I need help because I'm too shallow.

Today, I had two of my best friends respectively cut me off. The first one told me he never cared about me, and the second one told me I was selfish, even though I comforted him after he sexually assaulted me. I can't tell if I'm unlucky or the world's worst person.

I think my bobst crush finished midterms and I'm low-key kind of upset

I said a dude was handsome once like 2 weeks ago and now all my friends are literally pressuring me into being gay. They say things like maybe you just don't know it yet or why don't you just try it?. Um maybe cuz I don't like men? I know they're trying to be supportive especially in this new social climate but enough is enough. I know I'm def not the most masculine guy and I've def had people mistake me for gay before, but if I say I'm not gay I'm not fucking gay and people need to stop needling me about it.

I found out I had genital herpes the other day. I went home last weekend crying and told my mother, who is my best friend, that I thought my life was over and that I'd never orgasm ever again. Today, I got an email from my dorm that I had a package. My mother sent me a vibrator.

I'm a straight guy and I'm legitimately confused as to what I'm supposed to be doing to support feminism in response to the me too movement. I feel like if I continue to just listen like they ask me to do then I get scrutinized for not taking any action, but then when I try to speak out in favor of faminsim, or actively try to promote the ideals and beliefs, I'm seen as a pseudo-feminist who isn't really able to understand what I'm talking about. I've talked to my female friends about ideas that I have to try to make a change and all I get is conflicting opinions saying that I shouldn't try to do anything as it would draw attention away from what matters, but then I constantly hear that it's time for men to do something. That's all I want to do, is to do something that will show women that men understand and are there to help without coming off as fake or taking the attention away from the issue at hand. Women, I'm on your side and I want to do something, but I just don't know what to do.

I'm a Jew and I'm pro-Palestine. As much as I want to get involved with SJP, I can't because my family will disown me. I wish that more people would realize how intertwined this issue has become to Judaism itself. In hebrew school, we learned that Palestinians were evil murderers. Anyone who even asked for the other side of the story was severely punished. I hate that I feel like I have to choose between my Jewish identity and my political beliefs.

Today I was studying for an exam in the Gallatin building when I needed to pee. I opened one of the bathroom doors to find a couple vigorously fucking. Glad ya'll found an outlet to handle to stress of miderms!

I was drunk at a friend's house. Her roommate - a boy - offered to take me upstairs to his bedroom so I could sleep. He said he would sleep on the couch downstairs. But still, I wouldn't go with him until my other friend - a girl - went with me to make sure I was ok. In the morning, I woke up and almost apologized to my friend's roommate because I felt I had made him feel awkward. But I didn't apologize to him. While I'm sure he had no intention to harm me, I had no guarantee of that because as a woman, I've been conditioned to fear men's actions. I'm thankful for my friend's roommate for being kind. He's a sweet guy. But if I had a dollar for every time a sweet guy turned out to be not so sweet, well, I'd obviously be very, very rich. No more apology culture. Men, you've made this name for yourselves. Now fucking fix it.

I don't like judging people's choices, but it really sucks to walk by a smoker because I have asthma. Whenever I'm stuck walking behind or standing next to someone who's smoking and my throat starts to seize up, I can't help hoping karma gets them back later.

This week, my girlfriend broke up with me, I lost my job, learned my best friend is moving far away after this semester and have a terrible cold, but somehow my makeup has managed to stay perfectly in tact even throughout the hours of crying, so I guess all is well?

My professor asked my class if anyone wants to teach her morning class so she can get drunk tonight. I'm inspired.

There's a restaurant called Bowlin across the street from the silver center. I eat there everyday just to see the muscular, super hot man who is in charge of making the bowls. Please bowl me if you know what I mean

I had sex on my roommate's bed and basically my partner and I both came all over my roommate's un-sheeted pillow. I re-covered his pillow and last night my roommate mentioned that his pillow smelled especially nice for some reason, oops

i'm too scared to post that on my actual facebook because i'm still facebook friends with the guy and i know he doesn't remember that day the same way i do

I got into a section of a language class where everyone else is from the same class beforehand, and I'm not into side talks during class (it wastes the professor's time, and my money that I'm paying for the class). So I made a brilliant plan of doing a social experiment where I act like a complete asshole Sternie stereotype just in that class to gauge my classmates' reactions, like making all my answers business related. It's been entertaining as hell so far. I noticed that LS and Tisch students react/laugh at me the most, where CAS students are the most neutral. I look forward for my class every day to be the best asshole. It's fantastic.

A few months ago, I was sexually assaulted. I was heartbroken, disappointed and for some time, unsure of how to cope. Long story short, I decided to channel my anger and sadness into many of the mental health/wellness initiatives I've launched through this page, in the hopes that they would maybe help someone who had experienced something similar. If you've ever been sexually harassed, sexually assaulted or raped, please know that you're never alone, that time heals all wounds, and that help is out there.

Fml right now. I've been slacking off in school for the past four years because I thought that one day I would inherit close to a billion dollars in assets from my dad. Come to find out the fool just had another child at the age of 67 with his 20 year old mistress, who I am now probably going to share my inheritance with. Now instead of everything going to me it's more than likely going to be split three ways. This is so messed up, idk what to do.

In my culture, it's standard for a son to give his first month's payment to his mom. I live at home and it's something my older brother did, and so did my dad with his mom. It honestly felt pretty crappy to do the wire transfer, since my parents recently just spend money freely and I know they're just going to use it to buy some more shit we don't need. I'm scared that this first payment will become standard, as proof that I am capable of continuously paying for my parents while I live under their roof. I'm even more scared I'll never be able to save up enough (exactly why I stayed at home in the first place after graduating) to move out somewhere worthwhile. Why should I feel obligated to do so much more for my parents than they ever did for theirs?. (This secret was brought to you by daddy issues)

I'm a commuter student and I live with my parents in their apartment on the Upper East Side. Last night, I brought home my boyfriend, thinking my parents wouldn't be home until late. After a few drinks, me and the guy start hooking up in the living room and things get really steamy. Literally the moment I yell out Oh yes, daddy! the front door swings open and my father, who doesn't know I'm gay walks in. We haven't spoken since. FML.

If you were ever thinking about taking exams at the Moses center, I discourage you to do so. The environment is horrible and you are constantly being watched on cameras. They have falsely accused me of cheating twice. Their justification? I dropped a napkin and that apparently looked suspicious on cameras. I now have to deal with a number of staff members to prove my innocence. How are they helping people with learning disabilities if all they are doing is alleviating anxiety? The same goes for the Wellness exchange. The amount of times I have been dismissed, told to sleep on it etc. Seriously NYU. If you were easier to sue, I would be a fucking billionaire.

As a proud Sternie who sees the anti-Stern sentiment on this page and feels incredible sad about it ... why does everyone hate us? We're following our passions, just like the rest of you. A majority of us came here to learn about business so that we can try to do good and make a difference in the world in the ways that we can - is that so bad?

I was in my friend's room when I asked him what he was dressing up as for Halloween. He pulls out all of his Stern branded things: water bottle, shirt, hoodie, duffle bag, hat and a couple of stickers. Me: 'you're going as a Sternie?' Him: 'Nah an obnoxious prick'

To the OP who anonymously sent in a secret last night about a professor who allegedly sexually harassed multiple students who tried reporting it twice to no avail - I just got off the phone with the president's office and a few other people in an attempt to report it. If you feel comfortable, please DM the page for details. Let me know if you have any questions, or if there's anything else I can do to help you. Thanks.

A random drunk girl climbed in through my open window from my fire escape and asked if she could use my bathroom. Keep in mind that I was ass naked at the time and my fuck buddy was balls deep inside me. She did ask how the sex was, which was nice.

My quiet, religiously conservative roommate got a girlfriend a few weeks ago. They hang out in our room a lot which is fine, they're pretty chill, and the first time he asked about her staying over I thought nothing of it, having heard his spiel about his faith and devotion to celibacy until marriage. Fast forward to last night when I wake up at 3am to take a piss, and hear creaking bedsprings and muffled, awkward moans from 5 feet away. Never in my life have I wished harder for a Polaroid camera, because I would've framed the look of sheer horror in his moonlit eyes.

Am I the only one who thinks the new security guard at Bobst is super hot? He stands on the left side of the lobby in the morning/ early afternoon looking so damn fine in his uniform, and he's always got that serious ‘I ain't letting anyone in this god damn library without their NYU ID card' face. Now I only enter Bobst from the left side in the morning/afternoon just so I can make eye contact with him.

I still don't know why they put the Wellness Expo in front of Stern. Like, I obviously wouldn't be in Stern if I gave two shits about my mental health.

I've been dating a girl for almost two years now. I'm a mixed-race POC and she's aryan as fuck. Today, after acting oddly standoffish and squeamish for a few months, she left me, saying that she just couldn't date someone who was non white anymore, because apparently there are things POC can't understand. I'm livid and heartbroken and entirely disappointed. I really thought I was going to spend my life with this girl, and over the span of a few months, she turns into a white nationalist. Why does it take so long for some people's true colors to come out?

Being celibate in this school (and college in general) has been rougher than I anticipated. My friends constantly base conversations on sex stories, and I can't do much else other than nod and smile. People either tease me or respect me for keeping my virginity. Experiences on dating apps haven't been the best, since delayed sex or no sex doesn't sit well with most people. It's come to the point where I don't even want to bother with dating anymore. This isn't a knock on sexually-active people -- all the power to y'all. I don't plan on changing my stance, but I can't help but feeling like an outsider, socially and romantically.

Last semester my professor told us during our second to last class that we need to email our final papers to her as class is cancelled because she is having her baby. We all were soooo shook and literally thought she was joking. Plot twist, she was pregnant the entire time. I was sipping the coffee that made me late (meme reference) and actually choked on it. The class tried to backtrack and act like we knew, but it we were too far gone. She literally said, “I can't believe you guys thought I was just fat.” Sis tried to play it off, but when she was grading our final papers she definitely took each of our reactions into account. Moral of the story is: if a professor is making an announcement, put all liquids down.[.C]
Sounds like you're better off without her. She sounds like a terrible human being at heart and her true colors emerged. I hope you find someone more deserving of your affection

Could we have feast on weekends?

Would anyone be interested in getting together and forming a drum circle club? It would be super fun to get a weekly thing going but I don't know many other people who would be interested.  #uclasecretsclub
