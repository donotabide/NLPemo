Want (new) emotionally close people to hurt me physically: So I thought it was a common thing, but to my surprise Google did not think like that. Whenever I am getting emotionally close with someone, either a crush or just a friend with whom we talk a lot one-on-one, I want them to hurt me physically. It happens with pretty much every new close person and this pattern itself has been present since childhood. It sounds a bit crazy written like that, but I do believe it is actually quite usual. I have not figured out the mechanism. It might be partly to punish myself for getting close with someone. It might be partly to "test" people, to see, how far I can make them go. And to avoid disappointment and trusting them. It is partly just to "get it over with", like a compulsion. Does anyone else have this or does it ring a bell? I have a background of ~15 years of on-and-off self-injury every other year or so. I do not think I have BPD or anything like that, maybe slight PTSD. It's not a sexual thing. And I am highly functional, manage my work and uni etc very well. Ideas about the mechanism?

I’m not sure if this is the right section but I think it’s time for me to start talking about one incident that kept happening to me in school that I keep trying to repress for close to twenty years now. I’m giving a spoiler warning as my story involves sexual assault. I think what is occurring in Hollywood right now is triggering memories I keep trying to forget. Basically the story is when I was in ninth grade,which was from 2000-2001, I was walking down the hall from the locker room to the gym when I felt someone touching me inappropriately from behind and laughing about it. I was horrified and ran off terrified and the female gym teacher saw me run away frightened and went after me. I know who did it because the kid panicked when I ran and screamed “Oh no!” I was too afraid to talk about what he did to me and wouldn’t tell the teacher what had occurred. The gym teachers eventually found out through the others I guess but the kid who did this to me didn’t seem to be punished enough for what he did. I was too traumatized by it that I didn’t even tell my family that I was sexually assaulted. Then the same thing kept happening to me every day I had gym in the locker room for months and whoever kept doing it to me always ran off quickly enough that I never saw who it was but I’m 95% sure it was the same one who did it the first time since he kept bullying me in other ways until graduation. I became so afraid of gym that I would change quickly without ever turning my back and making sure I was the first to get changed and in the gym and first to change and leave the locker room. That is when the school called the crazy lady (the one who abused after she started drinking). She confronted me and then tried to get me to talk but I still refused to annd she then said to me, “That proves you aren’t gay!” as if I was supposed to enjoy being violated the way I was. The last three months of that school year I had to switch to the adaptive gym class for handicapped kids because I was too afraid to go to regular gym.My fear is that he is a sex offender now that is still hurting people and getting away with it because the victims he hurt are also too afraid to talk about it. I’ve felt this way for years but I know that I can’t press charges against him because it was so long ago. Part of me wants to shout out his name as a sexual predator but part of me knows I can’t because of privacy laws and I have no real proof other than the horrible memory of what he did to me. Plus his family has quite a bit of money and I don’t so he’d probably win the case anyway. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m pretty sure if it weren’t for my meds and my dislike of the taste of alcohol, I’d be drinking heavily just to repress the memory of my sexual assault. It was that traumatic for me.

I need friends, but I don't know how to go about making any. I'm 42, diagnosed with bipolar 2, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and PTSD. I feel so depressed right now. I work full time, but am still living pay check to pay check, and I am exhausted, both physically and emotionally. I need a life outside of work, but I fear I have nothing to give in a friendship, let alone more than one friendship.

Hi everyone, this is my first time posting on a forum but I don’t know anyone who really understands how am feeling so am hoping to find someone who does. I am 30 years old and for aslong as I can remember I have felt this underlying sadness but lately I feel like I am unable to hide it. I am not sure where it stems from and I think that’s the issue because I don’t exactly know how to take the steps to fix something when am not sure of the cause. I have terrible negative thoughts about people close to me dying, I feel like there is something missing inside of me to make me happy. I have members of my family who are struggling with depression and I don’t know how to handle it, I know it’s not about me because they are the ones who are depressed, but it’s like I love them so much I can’t deal with the sadness of them being sad so I completely shut down and this can make me seem heartless but I just don’t know how to react so I become numb. I am always the person who offers the best advice and people think I am really strong so for me to come out and say I have been feeling this way it would be such a big shock and I don’t like being the centre of attention so I keep it all in. It’s now affecting my relationship with my partner, as me feeling numb and not being able to communicate my feelings comes across as me being heartless and he isn’t going to stick around for much longer. Somewhere along the line I have learn that showing. your emotions makes you vunerable and I don’t want to be seen in that way. Does anyone else experience anything like this? Everything seems like a big effort I know am not depressed, well I don’t think I am, but something isn’t right. I hope someone can relate to me in some way.

I just don't care. About anything. I cannot help but not care, at all. I believe I am a narcissist. I have come to the point of not wanting to do anything besides sleeping and eating and staying warm this winter. Whenever I try to force myself to do other things, I start feeling incredibly tired and careless. That, and my focus and memory are gone. My mind goes into complete chaos and aggravation. I am constantly depressed. My mood stabilizing pills and anti-depressants don't really do much I think. I am simply a parasite off of my parents. And I don't really care about them either. I have no emotions. Like I said, I'm a narcissist. I still have a fear of death, of dying and being judged by the Christian God. And also a natural fear of death and bleeding in particular. Yet, I feel that I might still be able to commit suicide. However, right now my conditions are not that bad I feel, so there's that that's preventing me. I also know that killing myself would make my parents and relatives sad, so I think I won't do it anytime soon while they are still alive, hopefully. But when there's no one to support me, that's a different kettle of fish. Is there any advice people can give this narcissist, or is there anyone in similar shoes?

Racing thoughts: Does anyone else suffer with this? I get it really bad at night and it keeps me awake and goes through to the day sometimes. It's just one of my symptoms but I haven't been diagnosed with anything in particular yet. I go through what I've done though the day, what I didn't do, conversations I've had wih people, what should I do tomorrow or now. Maybe I should change clothes, 3 or 4 times just to put pj's on again. It's never ending. The way I explain it to my pdoc is its like trying to watch 3 TVs at once. I had it really bad yesterday and rang my support worker and all I could say was "I don't know how I feel, it's just like, I feel like, like, like" I got annoyed with myself in the end and told her "I just like, can't even think" I couldn't even make real sentences. It was scary but I feel better today after a good night sleep. I was told a few months ago I was having a psychotic episode and that's it really. But isn't psychosis just a symptom of something else?

does anyone know what’s wrong with me? for as long as i can remember, i have not been able to feel sympathy/empathy. i pretend to care when others are upset because i feel like i should, but for some reason when others cry or are upset i think the issue is petty and unimportant. to sum it up, i just get annoyed. on top of that, i feel empty. all of the ‘emotions’ i show on the surface are faked. i’m never happy, and i’m never necessarily sad. i’m just emotionless, and the only emotion i can actually feel is anger. i get angry extremely easy, and i find myself snapping at others a lot. my friends always tell me i’m so nice and sweet, but i’m really not. it’s all faked. everything about my personality is fake because i don’t feel anything. i sometimes feel remorse, but only if i get in trouble for something i’ve done. lastly, i tend to only be motivated to do the things that will benefit me. as selfish as it sounds, i can’t help it. i have no idea what’s wrong, but i know it’s not okay. if you have an idea of what i’m talking about, please reply because i could really use some advice.

Fell out with my mother over depression. Hi all, I have suffered with depression and anxiety on and off for a few years now but this past year has been the worst for me. I am on sertraline 50mg and propronalol 140mg. I had a really upsetting episode the other morning and ended up on the phone to the crisis team. I won’t go into all the details but the first person I wanted to speak to was my mam. She ended up telling me she was done with me, I have a perfect life. People have children murdered or raped, and if I had real depression I wouldn’t be able to go out for my partners birhday, and I would of killed myself by now. She then went on to say she felt like she had lost a child with me, I don’t have a relationship with my brothers and sisters, and my boyfriend doesn’t understand me even when he says he does. I am silly for feeling this way because I don’t have a real reason. She was brought up with a paedophile dad and she is skint and can’t afford my siblings Christmas presents so if anyone should be in a dark hole it should be her. She said depressed people don’t air their problems on social media (even though I feel this helps me as I want more people to understand) she said people won’t understand as they aren’t my friends. My mam really upset me she said she’s done with me now and asif I don’t already feel guilty enough for feeling this way she’s now made me feel stupid and pathetic and unworthy. I’ve had to take 3 weeks off work just to sort my Head out. I can’t explain what goes on in my head so how Can I make her understand. She has really upset me and made my illness worse and it’s my 21st birthday on Wednesday and I doubt we will be even made up for that.

I just feel so hopeless: I am in a very bad spot in my life right now. I have battled with depression on and off, but I am currently in a downward spiral of despair. I lost my mom less than two weeks ago. She wasn’t doing well, was in the hospital and she just stopped breathing, everything. They tried to bring her back but nothing could be done. I lost my dad to cancer 2 years ago. I’m 38 y.o., childless. I’m married, but I just don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to hurt my husband, but I just am very very depressed. I know I have to get professional help but it just seems like nothing ever is going to help. I hate my job, don’t have anything to live for. I guess I don’t even know why I’m writing this because I don’t think anything can help. I see nothing ahead for me. I am so lost, I feel like nothing is worth living for.

Advice desperately needed: I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't know if anyone will care. I don't know if I'm just being weak and pathetic here. If you've got a few minutes, please read.. I don't even know what I'm going to write yet but I really need someone to hear it. I broke up with my boyfriend about two weeks ago. I was with him for two years. Those years were filled with an imbalance of emotional distress. I tried, for a large part of it, to ignore my own emotions entirley and give all to help him. After about a year I guess this self suppression became too much and it all started to bubble over, like a stove kettle heated and forgotten. He was a lot older than me. He never ever was physically abusive, unless you can count preventing me from leaving in times of great distress (which I won't, as so many people suffer so greatly). I don't know if he really loved me. But he blamed me for not being able to help him enough. He blamed me for him not having a job. He blamed me for his lying and consequent stealing ( it broke my heart and dreamsof the future when I found out he was lying about ever having a job, actually getting up each morning to pretend to go, and was at the same time stealing hundreds from my house, my room and my mother.) And I STILL took him back, he spoke sweetly and I was trapped again. He told me this was special, no one had anything like this, and oh, if I ever left he would kill himself. " answer the phone now, or I die.' If you ever do drugs again not only will I die but that will be it I will never forgive you you f****** druggy' *two weeks later*: oh I got some stuff for us, we're doing it!!!' He didn't want me to see friends without him present and I was scared to do so as he always caused a huge scene and they wouldn't want to see me anymore. I wasn't allowed male friends really, which is ok I guess I understand. I work alot and help around the house alot due to it being very needed at home, and although he didn't work and I saw him everyday he was always saying how I didn't give him enough time. he used to harm himself and when with an old group of his friends LOVED really really humilating me from time to time, getting them all to hate me and then not telling me they did and getting upset when I didn't want to go there. And when I didit was always drugs drugs drugs and an atmosphere of hostility. I was so scared to leave for a long time it was easier to stay. The stealing kind of ended it for me butI thought the problem was me not listening or caring enough and that I just needed to be better somehow. The constant atguements and doubt werepiling on topof years of emotional pain, trauma and dirstress and maybe it was all my fault or just partly but.. I'm going on here I know this is boring. No one will read this much for me, but I'llkeep typing anyway. So I broke up with him after a horrible argument in which he said " well do you know why I've always lied to you about so much?? It's YOU. You don't care and you don't listen ! I don't have a job because of YOU you won't help me ! My friend X had his girfriend take his CVS out everywhere why can't you be more like her???" I said get out. Its over. I was crying and shaking asking for a break saying I'm sorry I just need to build myself up again please give me some time and he said no. We aren't having a break. I locked him out and said im sorry it's over please go. It was 11 pm or later and he was shouting and crying knowing my family was sleeping, he could see me in great distress through the window and kept tapping it over and over and over and over and over and over an over and over and over and over. I was in such a state when he finally left. Then came the sweet messages. For once I didn't give in. This hurt so bad because I did love him but slowly dawned upon me a sense of freedom and I realised I could be a teenager again. That weekend, about a week after, I went out and did pills. With my friend at her flat. A guy lives in the same building, lets call him J. I was drugged up and happy and untouchable and I kissed and hugged him. My friend had to leave for some reason or another so after a heavy night I stayed in Js room.I mustof looked like such a freak, in his bed with a thick hoody on terrified he would see my abudence of scars and realise I am not fun and happy and nice and sociable and funny or pretty. I had sex with him thatnext morning. It was so stupid. I didn't think I was that type of girl. I regret it alot. But J and I carried on speaking over text and he kept saying he really likes me blah blah trying to get me to come and see him and texting me all the time. Ex found out and I denied it which was probably wrong but he was going to over there and kill the guy. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm going there on Friday for a party. I'm going to be staying with J. Schizoprenia runs in my genes unfortunately, I grew up around a close family member suffering eith it. They all day marijuana switched something in his head. He died three years ago I miss him a lot. I insult him as I have smoked alot of weed. I have done many drugs. I don't smoke as much anymore. Well last night Iwent for a smoke with a mate in another mates car the music was loud and all seemed good I got really high and the twisted stories ( I hesitate to call it paranoia due to the pains of people I have met ) . I thought J was only seeing me so he could film me having sex with him and use it to blackmail me. Thatour mutual friend was in on it and maybeshe and J are sleeping together and she wants revenge for something I have forgotten or never realised.I thought Ex was in on it all too. That I am a huge joke and everyone isin on something. Everyone knows something I dont. I never am smoking weed again, I was so quiet and scared I bet the people I wss with thought I was a freak and i haven't told J maybe some part of me realises it's all stupid and unlikely . I can't eat, I had a some problems with food when I was about 11 of 12. Also self harm, alot of it. I was homless and lived with a family member who wss having a mental breakdown at this age. i witnessed someone self harming badly.. I never lived in a housefor more than 2 years before this, I had no long term friends. We went into care. Didn't stay long. Came out and family member was a lot better and amazing I must say she is amazing. I am not meant to talk about this irs the past i need to get over it right. So a little or i guess long while later when I met Ex I thought he wwas my saviour I was so mentally screwed. I feel like the pains of our relationship have just gone into the same jar and now it's cracking. I can't eat and I'm already skinny enough in myopinion I want to put on weight and I'm just losing it. I work looking after the elderly and I love it but everything feels fake. I just cry all of the time. There is this horrible anxiouspulsating fuzzy weight in my chest and I can't sit still I can't focus on anything I can't do anything I can't sleep until early hours and then I sleep for ages and I'm still tired and I know I suck. This is all pathetic. No one will read this. I have antidepressants prescribed but I'm so scaredd of feeling worse for a month that I haven't taken them and my own personal goal is to tackle this without them but I guess I personally can't do this. I get suicidal thoughts alot but I simply can't leave my family they love and depend on me to some extent I guess I have quite a lot of responsibility in comparison to some of peers as far as I can observe but I'm so scared I'm going to the friwnds and Js on Friday to do pills with all of these other people and when I'm on it I'll shine and be confident and amazing and lovely and I can pretend to be all of these things sometimes like at work but I feel it's all fake im nothing but a parisite at my core. I'm so sad and scared . I'm sorry for wasting your time if anyone did read this it's all pretty pathetic huh? What a waste of time

Neighbors harassing me: Hi guys my neighbors have been harassing me by shining lasers at my window, they use it with a drone. I can hear the drone flying near my window and can see the laser shining at my window though haven't been able to catch it with a camera. I have had to got to hospital to be medicated for a week because it got too much. They keep me up throughout the night and when I get up I can hear them laughing like they are happy harassing me! I have told friends and my mother and they think I'm going mad. Can anyone help me at all???

Shell-shocked: I don't really know where to start, but I'm here because I wanted to find somewhere where others have relatable experiences. I hope it's okay to post in this section; I have done because it doesn't necessarily fit a specific single illness, and is more my experience of the last several months. I have a long history of on-off depression which has gone untreated for years. In spring, I started feeling 'fast'. That's the best way I can describe it. Everything had been going great, I was working well, achieving a lot, and then everything went fast. To start with that was okay; I've never been a great sleeper so I didn't think it was a big deal when I stopped sleeping and I was filling every hour with productive things (work, home improvements, exercise, future plans, you name it). But things got faster and faster and I got more and more impulsive. Sometimes I didn't care, and it felt great but at other times I knew something wasn't right and I felt torn apart because I was out of control. I was referred to my local MH services for mood disorders but there was a long wait to be seen. By July, everything escalated and I experienced my first episode of psychosis. This lasted on and off for a month or so, and no medication they gave me touched me at all - I couldn't sleep, I couldn't stop. I'll not go into details but eventually I crashed down from this, and ever since have been spiraling into the worst depression I have ever experienced. I'm so lost. I'm shellshocked by what has happened to my life. I'm mortified by what I've put my partner (lives away) and a few close friends through. I'm exhausted. I keep doing the things you're supposed to do - I get up in the morning, I take exercise, I've moved back to my parents because I needed other people around me to provide some structure (some expectation to get up and function). It doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm supposed to return to work this month. I don't know how I can do that. I'm going through the motions and it just gets harder and harder to keep awful thoughts at bay. I'm under the early intervention team. They are treating me cautiously for bipolar I think, but won't make a diagnosis because they 'don't want to label' me. I don't expect a miracle from them, but nothing they have done or said helps at all. They just tell me it takes time, but I don't feel I have time. I know nobody here can fix this for me. I don't expect that. But I just wondered if any of you have any ideas how to pick yourself up and move forwards from a major MH episode that's left you feeling like I do now? And I guess I want to know I'm not the only one who feels like this. I think I feel like I've lost control and I need to regain that some how, but nothing I do seems to help. Thanks to anybody who reads this.

Seeking Advice: Hello. This time I'm seeking advice. I think the first time I'm doing so. How can I kill feelings and emotions inside? I wanna kill my sense of logic and thinking as well. In simple words, I want to become a robot. How can I do it?

advice in surviving suicidal thoughts: I've become a regular in posting here, on one hand it's good because I can share things I could not before, on the other hand it's like a sign of desperation and pain. I want advice from people who have experienced it or ones who are professionals - how do you survive these periods of intense feelings of hopelessness and desperation to the point of suicidal urges that are becoming increasingly prominent and terrifying. I'm trying to work with myself to achieve change for the better but I can't do it when I'm that hopeless. It's scary that I'm in this place and sometimes think that I have no choice except ending it all. I don't want to act on these thoughts but I just can't control them, it's like morbid thoughts. Please sharr from your experience.

reported my neighbour for child neglect and drugs: I'm feeling really sick right now. Thursday I reported my neighbour for the neglect of her 1 yr old. He screams 18 out of 24. There's no input with him he doesn't speak and he's stuck at home while the house in darkness as she never opens the blinds. She smokes cannabis from getting up to going to sleep. She then goes and puts the baby in the car and drives under the influence of drugs. Seriously causing me mental distress. I often disassociate as it causes me distress. I just couldn't cope I felt bad I had to tell my dr. So it's been reported to safe guarding department. But what happens next will they find out it's me and will they take her baby away. I wouldn't cope if they took him away. But I can't take it back. Please someone help me. I feel so bad and it's making me ill I'm taking it out on myself. I'm scared I'm going to do something bad to myself with the guilt. (Meaning self harm)

completely hopeless: I don't know how I'll make it. When I feel like I tried everything and it doesn't help - therapy, medication, physical activity, everything. Nothing is helping, and suicidal thoughts are stronger than ever. When suicidal thoughts hit you there is know escape, I don't know how people overcome these places. I have tried to keeo it positive but I have completely collapsed mentally, I can't sleep even with pills, I feel like I am doomed. It is disappointing how I got to this place and that nothing have changed, I feel I have failed. I look at my family, friends, everybody is living their lives and I am stuck. I often think how they will react if I took my own life, how broken they will be, I just can't do this to them but the pain I'm experiencing right now is unbearable. Everything makes me feel bad and hopeless, and someone like me should have never reached this situation. This is the most hopeless and rock-bottom that I have ever felt. I wish I could change all this, change myself for the better, but I can't. The anxiety is too strong, I really don't know how I am going to survive and I feel so lame for writing this here.

My first post here. I'm looking for advice due to my neighbor who seems to have anger issues. For over a year now she has taken to shouting day in and day out at "Someone". I know its not me, I think its her ex-boyfriend who lives next door on the other side. Nothing unusual in that I guess but the problem is it is relentless, it never stops for days. This is having a detrimental effect on my own mental health as I cannot sleep when she is shouting. My Landlord doesn't care and, unlike an antisocial neighbor, she clearly has mental health issues so I don't want to complain to the council and get her evicted if she is already in poor mental health. So I don't know what to do. Currently I've had two days of this - without any break. She's even shouting at "Someone" while doing the housework. Some bad episodes she's often yelling at the top of her voice outside the next door but one. Sometimes bashing the door with a wheelie bin. The police have been round many times but they simply either don't care or don't want to get involved. I'm reluctant to go to her directly as I've been in the situation before where I have then become the object of their anger and had my car vandalised and attempted break ins. It's not as if she's a bad neighbour either as when she is, on the rare occasions placid, she has helped me. I feel I'm just stuck and there's nothing I can do. Currently I'm looking for a new flat before I get to the end of my tether but not a lot is available at my price point. Anyone got some help or advice for this kind of situation?

Anyone have a relative living with dementia?: Dementia touches a lot of people's lives, so is there anyone who wishes to talk about it on here? Just a thought

Hyperventilation: I don't remember if I've asked this question before, yet I'm sorry if I have. I've read on different sites that an anxiety attack, also called panic attack, causes hyperventilation. The thing is I tend to hyperventilate all the time and I also feel short of breath at every moment of the day. I yawn as a reason, I sigh as well and I also take random deep breaths (and after those randomly-timed deep breaths I feel my lungs are finally getting oxygen) potentially at every moment. All these symptoms have no roots in any physical problems. My question is whether this is still possible to be related to anxiety? I wish you all a great time.

My uncommon, irrational fear: I have three fears that I group together into a “fear of things moving that shouldn’t move” which sounds weird, but that’s just what I’ve always called this. Let me explain: Ever since I was really young, I’ve been so scared of things that sway (wind chimes, swing sets, hanging stuff, those giant inflatable flailing tubes that car dealerships always have), and toys that move (my neighbours had this little Christmas tree that opened its mouth and moved its hands that used to make me cry). As I grew up, these fears grew worse; I can’t sleep when it’s windy, as I know things outside are blowing around, I hate the thought of hair blowing in the wind, so I cut mine short, I took the drawstrings out of my hoodies, and I developed a fear of things floating in water (my grandparents live next to the ocean, so when we go boating, I have panic attacks thinking about floating around). My whole life, my friends and parents have made fun of me, and it’s honestly annoying that I fear going new places, as I won’t be able to prepare myself for things that may be hanging. I don’t have much else to say, but I’ll share some stories. In high school, my art teacher had to take all the kids art projects hanging from the ceiling down, as I expressed my discomfort to her. I can’t go in pools, as floaties give me awful anxiety; I go around and throw them out of the water if I can. When servers at restaurants accidentally hit the hanging lights above a table, I can never go back to that restaurant. I don’t go to one friend of my dads house, as she has huge vertical blinds that constantly move When I take a shirt off a hanger, I have to hold the hanger until it stops swinging, and if it hit another hanger, I freak out. I avoid the toy aisles in stores for obvious reasons. I’m tired of all these things running my life, does anyone know what I can do?

Insomnia...help! I have generalized anxiety disorder, I've had it since I was a kid. But a couple years ago, it started affecting my sleep. I talked to my psychiatrist about it and she prescribed me clonazapam for a short period which put me right out, but she eventually took me off it so I wouldn't become addicted. She then prescribed me Valium which in the beginning was helpful, but now it's not doing much for me. Now, I take 15mg of Valium, 10mg of Ambien, 3-4 over the counter sleep-aids (doxylamine succinate) and 3 melatonins...and this barely puts me to sleep, sometimes I still am tossing and turning or staring at the clock. Does anyone experience this? Does anyone have any other tips on how I can combat this without all these pills? I've tried meditation, establishing a routine, drinking chamomile tea, and none of this works. Please someone help!

I have been struggling so so much with my fiance at the moment. We have been together for 3 years and are due to get married next september - something ive always looked forward too but lately i just want to cancel it. When we first got together he was still dating another girl who he continued to see for 6 months into our relationship - he says just as a friend and nothing ever happened between them but he always hid it from me. He always pretended he didnt know and he forgot etcetc. After one year i found out he was watching porn. Every night. Now a lot of people have said that thats normal as he is a young guy and what not. But when i confronted him about it he told me its because im not good enough. Since this he has stopped watching the porn and we have a very good sex life - at times. There are times where he wants it constantly then there are others where we can go a month with no sex and it doesnt bother him. We bought our own house in march of this year and in may i found a pair of pants. Just simple black pants. But they are not mine as i couldnt get them passed my knees. He laughed it off and said they are probably my sisters.. who is bigger than me. We ended up having a couple of weeks apart after this because i was so so sure he had cheated on me. He still has never admitted anything to me and still denies everything. Lately he has been coming home really late. Friday he should of finished work at 1:30 but didnt come home until 6 as he 'worked late again' which has now been 5 days in a row. He is very protective of his phone. Even if he is trying to show me something and i go to hold the phone he pulls it away from me so i cant even hold the phone. He keeps telling me its all in my head and i think a lot of it is but i dont know what to do anymore. I love him more than anything in the world and i couldnt imagine my life without him yet this is all destroying me! I just need a lie detector machine or something to prove that he is or isnt telling me the truth

Family reaction: Hello. I am new here and have joined in the hope that I can discuss things with people who have been through similar things. My question for today relates to how your family has reacted to your anxiety/depression. In short, I suffer on and off from both and have done for many years but was formally diagnosed about 2.5 years ago. I used anti depressants for 2 years and was lucky enough to borrow some money from a supportive family member to pay to see a therapist and am now coping much better. But on first opening up to the other side of my family, I was met with disinterest at best and cruelty at worst. From an general lack of asking how I was to saying things like anxiety doesn't exist, I had made it up, my therapist had put ideas in my head and that I was too confused, lying about the causes. Sadly much of my problem has stemmed from interaction with these family members over the years so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. I don't need to tell you how painful and all consuming mental health issues can be, the worst few years were honestly the hardest thing I've ever gone through. So I have cut off these family members to protect myself from comments that perpetuated my issues, only to be tormented by further hurtful comments and ill feeling towards me from both them and other family. I struggle to understand how anyone could be so cruel to someone who is clearly suffering (and then question the decision for no contact). Perhaps they just don't understand, I will never really know. I am struggling today with the injustice of being treated so badly then being the villain for stepping away from them. Has anyone else experienced this? I'd be so interested to know how you've dealt with any feelings of guilt or anger or just that I am not the only one who has gone through this.

I can't get over something my manager and my mum said. I can't stop over thinking and obsessing about it. How can I get over it? I have been depressed for a few months now and just recently decided to go back to my old singing teacher for singing lessons. I was a bit nervous to see her again because it had been so many years. I thought that was very normal and to be expected. I had not seen her in about 3 years. So we met for the lesson and as we were talking out of nowhere out of the blue she said "it's not good to be so not sure all the time". I was already feeling very depressed and I found this very insulting. So I came home and told my mum (im still living at home and thought she would comfort me). Instead she said something that made me feel so much worse, she kind of agreed with my singing teacher and said "yeah you should be sure", "why not tell your teacher you are sure". The problem is I wasn't even sure what she was talking about. But the whole experience made me feel like its not ok to be "not sure" at times. Like, doesn't everyone go through times of uncertainty and change in their life where they are very unsure? Isn't it ok to be not sure or indecisive? I keep getting attacked by my singing teacher over this and feel very hurt and bullied. A lot of other students feel this way about her as well and myself and one other stopped going to lessons there. But what she said still bothers me. Is it ok to be not sure, aren't we all not sure at times? I'm in between jobs at the moment and employment is a bit uncertain. I feel not sure about what my next job is going to be, or how I'm going to use my degree. I guess im unsure about lots of things in life. My mum said something that implied this wasn't normal. She said something that drove me crazy, it really hurt and I haven't been able to get over it for weeks. She said I should always say I'm sure about things, even if I am not sure. I was going to sing at a gig my singing teacher offered me to sing at, but I didn't really feel ready yet to sing at it. I didn't really feel up for it. And even if I eventually would have been ready to sing at, I was so depressed that I didn't want to. Mum said just say you are sure (when I hadn't even practiced yet or rehearsed the song). It really upset me and made me so angry and I haven't been able to shake it. I've always been the kind of person who is confident enough to be honest. If I am not sure about something yet, I just say I'm not sure yet, I'm sure I'll be ready on the day I'm just not ready yet. I guess I just feel very attacked over this personality trait of mine. It makes me feel depressed that people are criticising something about who I am. I guess my questions are 1) Is it ok to be not sure at times? Aren't we all in life? 2) Isn't it more normal to say straight up. 'I'm not sure yet but will be ready on the day'. Why won't my mum listen to a different point of view? 3) Is it normal to disagree with your parents over fundamental life principles like this? Is it weird I don't agree with her about this? 4) what should I do to get over this / Stop obsessing about it and move on?

Bullying: I recently read about a person bullied by pupils and teachers and the way she solved the problem by moving schools. Why is it that the bullies always get protected? Those who bullied should have been held accountable. It's like the victims of bullying are often made to have counselling this is not right it is the bullies if anyone who should be made to take counselling. That then might solve the problem.

Scary symptoms of anxiety?? I have suffered with anxiety for about 4 years now. The thing I can't bare about anxiety is the scary symptoms that it causes! Not sure if anyone else gets this but I started getting muscle twitches (which have thankfully almost disappeared) and I also get pins and needles sensations in my finger tips, sometimes goes up my hand, in my feet that have on occasion gone up my leg. The only way I get rid of these symptoms is by distraction. I have health anxiety so bad and every little symptom I feel, convinces me that it's another serious illness. It affects my home life, sometimes my work life and just makes me feel like I'm going round the bend! I obsess over every little thing, it makes me so mad at myself....oh to be "normal"

Germphobia, opening up for the first time. Hi, I've had a germphobia for around 5 years now, for so long I kept it to myself and tried to deal with it in myself, I kept to myself for so long as to I was and still am embarrassed by it. I also thought I could get rid of it on my own. I have looked over what I wrote and it's quite lengthly, if you are able to give your time to give it a read and any response I would appreciate it a lot! It has gotten to the stage now I've had it for so long and it has effected my life bad, I've decided enough is enough I need to speak out in some way and try and seek help. It is something I've some what had a denial to by thinking I could get it to go away and telling myself "I don't want there to be something wrong with me" I had dealt with it on my own for a long while until others around me had noticed, the only person I can open up to and talk about it to is my girlfriend who has been so helpful and done so much for me, although I can open up and talk to her about it there is still some stuff I feel embarrassed of and can't tell her. Apologies for the long essay this is just the first I'm getting it properly of my chest and have so much to say. When I was younger I was never afraid of germs, it is something that started effecting me while I was in hospital for a few days, my brother pointed out about germs such as MRSA and me touching things and eating etc as like I said I had no issue with germs. From here it sort of got into my head and from what I can remember I suddenly had a fear of germs from when I wasn't in hospital, I wouldn't wear my clothes I had wore in hospital etc. Now hospital germs do not bother me at all and I've came now to be extremely afraid of toilet germs, I was on holiday and hadn't noticed our toilet was leaking from the bottom, a pair of my shorts ended up being soaked from the leaking toilet, I just got changed and brought the soaked shorts home with me and washed them when home and continued to wear them and clothes from my case without an issue. One day I was working and got some cat fieces on a cloth I was using to clean, I had a sore head after this and someone told me about toxoplasmosis and it's effects, this is when I started worrying about germs again. After a while I had a fear of germs from the toilet and would not wear any of my clothes from the holiday I had been on although I had wore them a lot before hearing about toxoplasmosis without a worry, I also wouldn't wear clothes that had been in drawers etc with those clothes as I felt they were contaminated. One day I went to the toilet and got splashed by toilet water, I started worrying about this, when i got homemade I washed my clothes then I started thinking the washing machine was contaminated and couldn't wash clothes in that washing machine but I could use towels my mum had washed in the washing machine to dry myself but could it wear the clothes. With my mum and dad wearing clothes they had washed in there as well as touching my clothes I felt were contaminated I began to feel like they were covered in germs, these germs from the toilet I fear; in my head spread, for example all over a person, all over a surface. If I get splashed my toilet water I would have to get showered for a very long time and throw out the shower gel I had used and clothes I was wearing etc. I regularly showered for very long periods and washed my hands for long periods when I felt dirty. I then began to feel like I couldn't eat stuff cooked in my parents house. I decided to move out to get away from the germs because it was really effecting my life and had essentially ruined it. I love my family but because of my phobia I stayed away from them for 2 years and didn't see them as I felt they were covered in germs. For around 6 months I was living with it well, I had a new job and wasn't able to go about my daily life again, then suddenly I was back to the bad fear, this then caused me to leave my job and eventually had me living in an actually germy environment, I would go days without getting washed as I felt I had no clean clothes I could wear, I wouldn't wash doe dirty surfaces, the house I was renting became a real dirty place that someone without s germphobia couldn't live in. I've since moved out and am back in my parents and seeing my family and don't feel like they are covered in germs anymore, my girlfriend and I got a new house closer to my parents and where I grew up but was alightly afraid of moving in because the toilet was right beside the bath/shower and was worried that by flushing the toilet that small amounts toilet water would sometimes splash into the bath. My girlfriends family have been in our old house (the one that got extremely dirty to the extent it was unliveable) as it belongs to a relative of theirs, my girlfriend cleaned it when we moved out as she knew I was unable and freaked out at the thought of it, although she cleaned the house I can't feel the house is clean as it was extremely dirty at the end when we moved out, her mum is a cleaner and gave it a proper clean when we moved out as would be when majority of tenancys end. Since then her mum got us a tv from her friend for our new house, I thought I was ok with it and got it brought to our house, now it's on our new house I feel like it isn't covered in germs and now my house is covered in germs, I've had the house for 3 months and haven't moved in because of this and have been trying to get over it myself but I'm realising I can't and I need help. Her family began to around a year ago I had a germphobia and now I'm home again my family have noticed and my mum has tried to get me to speak to my doctor but I didn't want to as I felt embarrassed and kind of didn't want anth to admit there was "something wrong with me". I know the phobia is silly and it's all on my head, but as much as I know that it's really silly I can't get over it. Sorry for such a long story just thought I would get it all out as this is the first I've opened up about it. If anyone could helped I would appreciate it so much as my life has basically been ruined from it. Also if anyone needs any help or to talk also I'm happy to help others in anyway.

Hair loss: I've been on antipsychotic meds for mental health for almost a decade and I have suffered from hair loss for a long time. I think the meds are making my hair fall out, I just wanted to know if there is anyone else experiencing this.

Feel like giving up: Hi and sorry in advance for my first post but I just don't know what to do. In the last year I have lost my father, gran, uncle, godparents, best friend and several other friends from cancer/accidents. Despite putting on a brave face and returning to work, my boss who knows about everything has been bullying me. I've been told to take action but I'm not strong enough despite plenty of evidence and witnesses. I'm on citalopram and speak to a specialist counsellor every fortnight but every time I'm alone my anxiety and depression take over. I have resigned due to the bullying. I just couldn't cope with it this year. No job to go to. A disabled brother to care for. Money worries. I just feel like giving up. There really is no joy in waking up. Feel like a total failure and have no idea how I can get through this

Anxiety? Not sure what to do! Helloo everyone 😊 just joined and this is my first post. I’m currently at university and spend a lot of my time on placement within a hospital. I’ve been there for about a year and 3 months. During this time I’ve gone from absolutely loving what I do to panicking when it comes to putting a mask on and getting scrubbed! I have had some issues... mainly the person in charge of me tends to go out of their way to make things difficult for me. I tend to keep myself to myself regarding my personal life and this is apparently causing problems because this particular person thinks I should be more open (and gossip). The other students in my group don’t really bother with me much because of this particular person saying stuff about me. I had my end of year test which I had to prepare for all by myself as they offered me no help unlike the other students. Spoken to uni about it and basically got told to man up. I go all sweaty and dizzy and start to feel sickly. It’s awful. Recently this week I’ve been set ‘targets’ by this person... this includes me sitting with our group of students whilst in lecturers rather than sitting with my friends. I also have to meet with them for a teambuilding lunch on my day off each week. I’m going to speak to Uni tomorrow to see if there is anything I can do. I’ve tried asking for a change of placement and they refused saying it would be character building for me. I honestly feel so fed up. I get panicky just being on a bus or in a shop! I feel like I’m a shadow of my former self. I avoid situations where I know I will panic 😩 I don’t want to go to the doctor if I can help it as I’m hoping to go in the forces once I qualify. Any help would be greatly appreciated

With psychotic depression can a mood be so low it is like a psychosis? is suicide a major factor in psychosis? what I mean is when a person is suicidal relating to depression is that considered a psychotic episode??

Life is sometimes too much to bear....money worries, stress and depression make it even harder. But how do you cope when everything you do in life just seems so pointless? Never really feeling suicidal, but not really wanting to be here either? How to deal with feeling like you are living a lie, playing a game, acting a play, keeping up the charade that everything is fine and normal and finding very little joy in anything? Feeling disconnected and alone with your thoughts and everything seems surreal. A bystander watching life pass by, but not feeling it? Afraid to share these thoughts and feelings with family and loved ones for fear of showing weakness or even unraveling completely just by admitting it out loud? Welcome to my life.

To start this, I'll be blunt and say I'm not even sure that I'm posting in the right place. Regardless, I hope you all can help me. To some of you this may be offensive. How do I know? If I’m a bad person, that is. Am I? My mind says no, but my heart says yes. Emotionally, I’m a harsh human being of almost zealous callousness. I can’t understand why. Why do I feel like I NEED to be callous? It’s even more stupid because I am so desperate for love. I feel alone. Is it a cycle that feeds itself? Do I sink further and further? I can’t even tell anymore. Let me give some examples, to state exactly what kind of person I am… -Whenever I hear of a mass shooting or bombing (or otherwise terrorist action, killing spree, etc.) I think about how it could be done better. -My last real girlfriend (non-distant relationship) broke up with me because I was “too psychologically unstable”. Her reason for saying this was that I threatened a guy who was hitting on her. (I am a 280 pound behemoth of a person- I’ve been told I look like an NFL lineman.) I told him I’d put him in the hospital. -I get angry at the DUMBEST things. People going one mile below the speed limit, old people in Walmart, you get the point. Dumb stuff. I legit get angry. -This is an oddball one. I once saw a stinkbug drowning in a cup of water, and moved by emotion, freed it from its captivity so it could live. Yet when I see someone break a bone or twist an ankle, I won’t move to help them. In many ways I abhor them for wasting my time. -I rarely smile. When I do it’s a dumb “I can’t control my smile” kind of smile. I hate it. I’ve gained some not good weight (college is a bitch) and hate how my smile looks now. Regardless, my common face is noted to be angry. -I can’t let go of grudges. A guy I knew in 4th grade ran into me the other day. I was a pretty emotional kid in elementary school and middle school, and it was easy to make me cry. This guy- he stole my pencil in 4th grade. I didn’t care about it, it wasn’t special. I legit cried when he stole it though. He tried to act friendly with me. I told him I hated him and he’d be doing society a favor by dying. -I want to join the armed forces just for comradery. Better than being alone. I figure if I die, I might do the world a favor anyway. -I measure people as a resource, ranging from valuable metals to literally more expendable than dirt. I consider myself dirt, the status quo of humanity. Perfectly expendable and easily replaceable. -I’m an atheist by default, not by choice. I feel like I’m “too smart” to believe in God. I know the bible wasn’t officially made canon until roughly 325 or something like that, and the Jewish version of god can’t exist if he allowed his people to nearly be exterminated in the Holocaust, right? I know this is an insult to religious individuals, and I’m sorry. I wish I could choose to ignore reality and place my faith into something I can’t see, but I literally can’t do it. This is it’s own set of issues, leading me to have NO spiritual balance. -I’m stubborn BEYOND comparison. I have lost friends over the STUPIDEST things. Just because I can’t NOT argue with them if we differ in opinion. I constantly feel like I will lose my best friends because their opinions differ from mine. -I hate drugs. What a fucking waste. Why the HELL do people take drugs? Ever? Also I do mean ILLEGAL ones. Weed… sorta counts. To me it does. I have nearly lost a friend to weed, and he wasted a lot of potential he has. -I make small lies consistently until I believe them. This is weird, I know. Sometimes my past is too blurred with lies and reality for me to remember what ACTUALLY happened. Everything I am saying here is the truth, but know that I lie all the time in person. Usually it’s just to be funny or talk about my ridiculous friends, the few I have. -I am a virgin. I’m 20. I feel isolated for that alone. For someone who doesn’t believe in eternal damnation or heaven (not really, at least…) I have a surprisingly strict moral code. I just can’t have sex with people if I don’t feel like it will be eternal. This is also a factor in my only two actual relationships ending. -I’m awkward. I stutter all the time and get anxious easily. Working retail has helped a bit, but it still happens quite often. I hope this has done some work to help you understand what kind of person I am. Yet all I feel like is a coward, a liar, a monster, and a criminal. I haven’t even committed any crimes, I just feel like I will one day. I feel ugly and unloved, more than that unlovable. I want help, and going to counseling hasn’t helped me. Is it a lack of maturity? Maybe self-hatred created from nothing? I should mention now that I have always been loved by my parents, but I feel like a disappointment. My brother is great at everything, and I’m useless. They always tell me that’s all in my head, and it’s true. Yet I can’t help but feel I am just a great big disappointment. Additionally, I was VERY depressed for about 6 or 7 years, starting with the death of my cat (my first memories are of her, and I love animals). A year or so later a friend shot himself (ruled an accident, but I know better. His parents believe that God had greater things in mind for him. I hope they die, I hate them more than anything in this world.) and ultimately I felt no difference. He was my friend, not even a good one. A friend nonetheless. At 14, it seemed so unreal to most. My commentary was more like “this kind of thing happens.” Please. Help me. I fear that at this rate, I will become suicidal (again), homicidal, and worst of all… that I will never be able to get a lasting relationship. I feel so unloved. I don’t feel like I deserve it. So please, help me. I need advice, even opinions. Anything will do.

im currently dealing with a lot of mental illnesses and I dont know how much more of it I can bare. Im currently diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Major Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Psychosis, Paranoia, Aspergers and lastly Sensory Interegation Disorder. I know its alot and you probably dont believe me but its true and I want someone to actually listen to me and not push me away because thats what people do to me... I dont have friends because of my Aspergers, Schizophrenia and paranoia; my "friends" will literally walk away faster than me put their headphones in and walk away so they cant hear me. Or tell all 5 of us in the group to go to a teachers classroom and hang out but only say "lets all 4 of us go to this teacher " when he knows there are 5 in the group.. I cant even meet new people because I cant look at people in their eyes when I talk or talk on the phone with them cause im completly scared out of my mind that they are making fun of me and are trying to hurt me but they are not and I know that but the voices inside tell me they are. Ive been on so much medicine and been to so many therapist appointments and psychiatrist appoints, but still cant help believe these delusions. To this day everyday Im depressed and have so many anxiety attacks and so much depersonalization i get scared so I cant help but self harm parts of my body i dislike and self harm in visible places so maybe people will help instead of pushing me away. I feel numb inside to a point I wanna kill myself and have attempted twice and still dont have a tear to shed no matter how hard I try to cry. I cant even eat food anymore because I constantly have an image and thoughts in my head of someone throwing up or nasty stuff in general

I was hoping that those of you that have been dx'ed with psychotic depression at one point or another) could share a few answers with me (if possible). Here they are: At what age were you dx'ed with psychotic depression? Did the psychosis start at the exact time as the depressive state? (If not which started 1st)? Once the depressive state was resolved did the psychotic features remain? Was there ever a time that you felt well enough that your doctor allowed you to wean off of your meds? If so, how long did the weaning process take? Did you ever relaspe?

I just want to die peacefully: I know I'll have to tiptoe around due to forum guidelines. I just want to go. My future looks bleak. I live in poverty, I have food but I cant afford my favorite drink. Soda. I'll continue to live in poverty. My benefits case has been open over 2 years now. My attorney says it may be another 2 years, possibly longer. I did some research the other day about substances that could be harmful. I checked into what I thought to be the most dangerous substance I can get my hands on. I found a pro suicide website that had an alphabetized list of dangerous substances as well as the quantity necessary to cause harm. I found out that there's another substance that I have that's even more harmful and in smaller quantities. Oddly enough there's a fairly common MH substance that requires over a thousand to be harmful. How in the hell could someone get a hold of that much of a substance? Then I looked into another section that listed levels of pain caused be certain actions and the length of time those actions would take to achieve a certain result. I still don't know if it was morbid curiousity or intention that drew me in. Today I'm thinking that I'm glad that I have the information. I'm thinking of harming myself. I just want the pain to go away. Maybe I'll get lucky and after you die there's just nothing. Nothing forever and ever and ever. This thought comforts me. I don't like the idea of a frozen hell or a burning hell. I have this mental image of a hell where everything is as twisted as my mind. Demons feasting upon the weak. Murders, torment, and torture. I have an image of hell being much like the earth, but in a post apocalyptic world. A ruined earth. In this place its everyone for themselves because every resident is just as sick and demented as you are. I think if there is a hell that's where I would want to be. Have you ever seen the movie Constantine? When he goes to hell that's a lot like my vision of hell. There would be a lot of bold colors there. Lots of black, crimson, and rust tones. Lots of darkness and eyes peering at you from the sewers and from under rocks. The shadow people I'm sure would be there. No longer in hiding. I could finally be able to challenge them face to face. Even a burning hell would be better than the insanity I suffer in my brain. I just want it to stop. Forever.

I have been self harming since Wednesday night. I self harmed. I wanted to do feel it again Thursday morning so I self harmed again and yesterday and today. I think I am now addicted. How am I gona stop??! Obiously I am struggling so much that is why I am self harming

Feel empty: Yesterday I tried to take my own life and ended up in hospital for most of the day, wasnt sectioned though. I feel so numb now and don't know what to do

first post so a bit new to all this. I'm in a residual rehab at this moment for both drugs and help with Bi Polar II. iv been steady for a while now thanks to taking my meds prober. but I am getting the odd days off manic depression and find it very hard to express the way I am feeling or even identify what's going on. I write a lot and this helps, using images to try and describe what is going on. I feel if I was to just rant it would come out as a "I hate the world, they way we are organised and the human race" rant but want to understand the core off this hate. the closest I think I can get to it is I feel like all my insides have been sucked out and replaced with a thick fog. or like iv been plugged in to something that's taking control of my soul.... self harming brings me back into this world for a while and gives me a rush, to that I find very addicting. I had gone about 2 months without self harming but relapsed early last week . and have gone from a Huge dip to Manic . what is also worrying me is I am starting to have thoughts off self harm even in manic phases. I will share more of my story in other posts . don't really know what I'm asking tbh but even the act of writing this down has helped.

Parenting a teen help advice: My daughter (15) has been self harming and we only found out about 3 weeks ago so we are new to this journey. My daughter is now seeing a psychologist, which she hates doing. She still tells us that what she is doing is fine because it works and there is nothing wrong with it. As her parents, we are now scared to discipline her for anything for fear that it might make the situation worse. Or that she will withdraw from us even more. Does anyone have experience with this or any advice on discipline? She has started shifting the friends that she hangs out with at school. She seems drawn to the more rebellious group of children. We hate to see her get more involved in unhealthy behaviours but we feel powerless to prevent it.

Recently I've become even more suicidal than I had previously been and am seriously considering taking my own life. My friends know of this, the NHS knows of this and they're doing nothing to help. Anyway, if it were to result in a failed suicide attempt what would happen if the police were involved? Would you be sectioned immediately or taken in for questioning?

Parent Seeking Advice: I recently found out that my daughter has been self-harming. We had a long and really open discussion about it in a non-confrontational way and she even proffered her tools which I hadn't intended to take off her. She said she hadn't harmed for quite a long time before this incident which was brought about by her first excursion into the town near her school to meet with friends and resulted in her being beaten up by a girl in the year above her at school who had been drinking alcohol all afternoon. I took my daughter to the Doctor to try and get a referral to CAMHS and arranged with work to be able to work one day a week from home so i could be around more, and had her signed off school for the last week. I have asked her if she wants to go back to school and she has said no - so I plan to let her be home-schooled from September. My concern is that having removed her from the people I believed had been causing her distress/abuse/bullying etc I now find it hard to understand why the desire to self harm is still happening as this was her first incident in a while (unless she wasn't truthful about this being the first instance). I've suggested she join a discussion forum so that if she feels the need to self-harm she could seek the support of others to help her but she is not very receptive to this idea or to the list of suggested alternatives that I found on the internet as ideas from people who had self harmed in the past and what they found useful. Despite me being open and non judgmental with her she still finds it difficult to talk to me when she has self harmed but will discuss it with her sisters (which is something). Just would really like to know what I should be doing to help her and feeling somewhat helpless instead.

I need help resisting the urge to self harm: About a month ago someone leaked nude pictures of me without my consent. The pictures included my name, face, and personal info. I was threatened that the photos would be sent to friends and family by the poster. I have been harassed and tormented online. I cry myself to sleep every night and I self harm almost everyday. I have constant thoughts of suicide. I have anxiety and paranoia about the photos being reposted or sent to my parents. I google my name every thirty minutes. The sound of notifications startle me, I'm afraid that it is someone telling me they found my pictures. The anxiety has also affected everyday things. I will check if I brought my keys with me every hour that I am not home and I check that I placed my books inside my backpack 10-20 times before I leave my apartment. I need to stop because its making me ill. I don't know what I can do to stop the urges. I want to stop but I don't know how.

Is physical self-punishment bad? I've heard of people giving themselves rewards for being able to do things they have trouble doing, and I've also heard of people (adults) punishing themselves when they do something they believe is wrong, either by depriving themselves of a treat (dessert, TV, etc.), or, in rare cases, by physically hurting (but not necessarily harming) themselves. Is punishing yourself, particularly by causing yourself (harmless) pain, wrong or unhealthy? I know this may be subjective, but I just wanted to hear other people's thoughts on it.

Unable to stop doing things which can get you in trouble. Does anyone exhibit stalker behavior when a significant loved one, family member, or friend ceases to talk to you? The person exhibiting the behavior knows it is wrong and dangerous but they do it anyways. Partly because of the excitement it generates coupled with moments of seeing the individual are to great to pass up.

cant stop buying things: I have a problem where I buy things all the time, I posted this on the depression forum but my post did'nt appear. I buy mostly from charity shops and have far too many clothes and shoes, this is a big problem for me as we have had to take out a loan. I want to save and go on holiday next year but am worried I will whittle money away. Does anyone else relate to this?

Going out alone: I suffer from Social Anxiety and going out on my own is really difficult. I can go to certain familiar places on my own, at the time of day when I know it's not going to be busy, but if I need to go somewhere unfamiliar or even somewhere familiar but during a busy time I need someone with me. How can I overcome this fear? Has anyone here experienced the same problem and how did you overcome it?

Clothes question: I know people can have issues with things like elastic,labels, and tags on clothes. What about the material though ie cotton, polyester, silk etc ? The most I ever noticed it was a shirt I had to wear for football from time to time when at prep school. I have no idea what the material was other than it wasn't polyester and didn't feel like normal cotton. I used to really dislike that sports shirt. The material was itchy and horrible against my skin . I never used to hear the other boys complaining though , and guess they had no problem with it.

Anyone been misdiagnosed with Asperger Syndrome when they have borderline personality disorder or they been misdiagnosed with BPD when in fact they have got Aspergers/autism? Anyone actually got both conditions? I know both conditions share similar traits, such as emotional reactivity, interpersonal difficulties, impulsive issues, and problems with odd thinking.

Everyone patronises me! I have aspergers and ADHD, so it's sometimes hard for me to perform tasks other people might find easy, or even talk to other people. I also have dyscalculia, so math is incredibly hard for me to work out, which probably makes me seem dumb whenever I have to handle money or something. So yeah, I'm pretty slow in a lot of ways, but I like to think I'm still good at other things, and have a basic understanding of the world to the point that I don't need to be hand-held! Of course, all of my peers disagree, and insist on talking down to me whenever they see me, they explain things to me with that patronising, condescending voice usually reserved for an animal or a toddler, they laugh at me whenever I do something silly or clumsy, and then go 'aaw sorry, let me help you', and whenever someone says anything even remotely challenging or subtle to me, they'll be like 'hey lay off him, he doesn't understand!' Even when I achieve things, they're sometimes patronising about it. I remember once when I started dating someone, people acted with surprise, as if it was impossible that a guy with a mind like mine could ever attract someone, and then they'd either treat me with pity (thinking it wouldn't last), or refuse to believe I was really dating them. I've written a novel, and four feature-length screenplays, all of which have gotten good responses from professionals I've sent them to, but in the eyes of my peers, they're just my little hobby that won't go anywhere, and they're probably terrible anyway. I've always felt like an outsider, and this attitude really hasn't helped, I'd probably be much closer with people and have less trouble connecting with them if they'd just treat me like a damn adult.

I think I might have Autism, but I'm not sure. Can someone help me, please? I am watching a Susan Boyle interview and they're talking about how she found out that she has Asperger's Syndrome. And they talk about how she felt like she didn't fit in back in school and had emotional outbursts, and I just relate to a lot of the side effects. Obviously this doesn't mean that I have this, but I've just been wondering. I went through tests and they first said I had Schizophrenia. Then Schizoaffective Disorder. And a few times, they even said I was Bipolar. I don't know what's true and what's not. Susan Boyle also mentioned that growing up, people thought she had a learning disability. When it comes to math, I have a learning disability there. I don't know if this is a connection to Autism, so I'm not sure if I can list it as a symptom.

Empathy - do I have it? A friend of mine says I have no empathy for other people. But I'm sure that I do. I just don't have it for babies and children (which most people seem to go absolutely ga-ga for - I hate them) When I had a girlfriend I loved her with all my heart and I wanted her to be happy (still do). I don't feel much for my mother, and I hardly grieved when my dad died. But I cry at films, (when they are happy). I get really involved in books - I feel what the hero feels. I'm sure I have empahty - it manifests in different ways. But I can't explain what those ways are

It sounds like your empathy is mostly around positive things, and not so strong around family. That doesn’t mean it’s not there. I’d suggest to your friend that maybe he needs to be more compassionate himself rather than making judgments. One exercise I’ve found really helpful around empathy and compassion is considering how other people suffer. Everyone suffers and has difficulties in their life. When people ask us, “how are you”, we generally just tell some niceties, we don’t really go into how we actually feel, how in fact we too suffer. But if you can imagine someone else’s suffering, it helps you to feel compassion for them, and that is empathy.

Eye contact-such a tricky one: I don't like to make eye contact but make myself do so because it's expected when you are interacting with people. I am never sure how long is too long though, and whether I'm over compensating or not. After all there's not making eye contact vs outright staring at someone. Thoughts welcomed.

Really Pissed Off: I have had massive problems my whole life, as long as I can remember, have never fitted-in, never really understood why. But I'm starting to When I was nipper in primary school, I took some real shit. I was once massively embarrassed by a teacher, who put me before the class and smacked my arse. I hate her guts - and she's still a teacher, or was until recently. Why did she smack my arse, and humiliate me in class? I had a problem - a very noticeable one. I used to nod my head, fling my arms out, spit out, make grunting sounds, and whisper or shout out 'piss off fucking hell' very quickly, and over and over. I couldn't help this. It just came, and if I didn't, it felt like I would burst. My family went back to our GP again and again and a-fucking-gain. I was in my first year of primary school when my arse was smacked, so I was pretty young. I did get to finally see a child psychiatrist in my first year of secondary - I was 11. That's a long time to go through highly toxic, stigmatizing, destructive shite, that makes you a massive laughing stock, and target for bullies, both child and adult. What did the psychiatrist conclude, after just about six sessions in the child guidance clinic? That I was 'well-adjusted', and there was nothing to worry about. Wow. And guess what? The same psychiatrist I read about in the local paper some years later, was sent to prison for being a dirty pedophile, who abused kids in his inpatient facility. Another wow. I wasn't an inpatient. I was an outpatient. But does a man who has a sexual interest in young children, have their best interests at heart? Does he fuck. He was a proper sadistic twat, who I maintain got off on fucking kids up, by leaving them untreated and in the shit. I believe I was deliberately case-closed with what at the time, was clearly Tourettes. My life is in ruins in some, if not all, respects. I have never had a career or anything productive to do, I do not connect with people all that well, I have no reliable circle of friends, I have no satisfactory intimate relationship. I had my last girlfriend at 16, and it lasted a week. I have had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and have recently been diagnosed with ASD. There are very suspect and highly questionable logs - both NHS and policing - attached to my address. I was first arrested in my 40's, and had no criminal or forensic history prior to that. I have NEVER been taken to court, despite trying in my own way, to secure some judicial and legal review of my situation. I wonder fucking why? Answers on a post card. Innit. LOL. You're supposed to receive a conviction notice or similar aren't you, when professionals in your care, are had up for serious offences. I have been ambushed too. I think the cowardly fucks in the NHS and the Police want to paint a bad a picture of me as they can, to cover their own dirty, sorry backsides.

How to control tics at some degree (from my personal experience). I am 18 now. I was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome approximately 2,5 years ago. I have noticed that changing place where you are located now (for example, going outdoor if tics started at home) can help a lot. I don`t have already that tics outdoor. They disappear. Certain tics are associated with certain enviroments, situations, people etc.

Tourettes & Tardive dyskinesia: I've read another thread about tardive dyskinesia and I'm concerned about this and wondered if anyone could give me any information on this condition and whether or not it may relate to what I have been through over the last 3-5 years. It may be completely unconnected.... My sons and my sister both had tics / ADD up until puberty. It was never determined whether Tourettes was the main or secondary diagnosis. I was not affected, but given the hereditary aspect, I am concerned that I may be at risk with dopamine antagonists and that this may have been the cause. I suffered extreme withdrawl problems (jaw clenching, parkinson type movements, extreme sweating and temperature control problems and autonomic nervous system failures) when I came off Escitalopram. I also suffered coronary muscle spasms during this period which the doctors couldn't explain. I was left with a slow and irregular heart beat.When I first took the drug I couldn't shut my eyes (literally) for 3 days and I felt "wired".... they reduced it to 5mg for two weeks and then kept me on it on a 10mg dose. All this was for very mild anxiety and depression. The "withdrawl" symptoms lasted for about 3 and a half years and 1 year in they gave me a pacemaker as it was clear that my heart muscle wasn't recovering. The symptoms waxed and waned during that period and 5 years later the other symptoms have petered out and pretty much gone, although I am left with a pacemaker. I was on the drug (on and off) for 7 years at a low dose and had no symptoms until I stopped taking it. I read in this information that Tourettes is a risk factor and that some SSRIs have been implicated as causing tardive dyskinesia. Does anyone know anything about this? Could I carry the gene for Tourettes if my sons have inherited it and my sister had it too? I didn't suffer myself. My doctor has referred me to a psych who seems intent on proving "health anxiety" or "personality disorder." Borderline PD is apparently characterised by intense emotions which are capable of inducing autonomic dysfunction, and the doctor's take seems to be that I had a heart problem anyway (!!!) (No family history, no risk factors, age 45 and no problems prior to taking the drug) and that BPD and intense health anxiety could cause me to have "imagined" that the autonomic problems were the fault of the drug. The psych seems to think I should go back on the drug....some kind of "exposure therapy".....He can forget it!! I also read a little about trauma causing this condition to develop/worsen. I was traumatised by being told I had suffered a heart attack (initially), and then by being told I would need heart surgery (pacemaker) and then being told that my autonomic nervous system wasn't working properly. It caused me to develop a deep depression and significant anxiety. Frankly I'm disgusted and insulted that they can dismiss this as "imagined" symptoms. They were very real and the pacemaker in my chest kind of proves that I didn't imagine that part! My mental health has fallen apart since and I'm struggling to be taken seriously as a result, because I'm angry and scared, and have become very negative. I'm really struggling with this. Can anyone shed any light? Does anyone know anything about Escitalopram and dopamine? I'd be really grateful for any information.
