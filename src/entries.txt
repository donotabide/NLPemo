I wish I could go back in time and protect myself from the pain, trauma, and abuse I ended up experiencing from my ex-gf as well as my ex-best friend. Even though I try to remind myself that it isn't shameful to be caring and empathetic, I nonetheless feel so much regret, shame, and disappointment, and I am haunted every day by PTSD from betrayal, assault, and heartbreak. Although I feel some measure of pride and relief that I am the type of person to take ownership of my mistakes and learn from them, I am disgusted and terrified for the people they interact with, because they definitely aren't. Personally, I'm exhausted by other people's bullshit. I disapprove of doubting people by default, but definitely, if someone is actually showing conflicting signals, even if it's subtle, please listen to your instincts and drop/drift away from the person ASAP to save yourself some heartache. Like yes, no one is wholly good or bad, but there's a distinct line beteeen character quirks / weaknesses and flaws that tend to result in abusive, toxic, and/or invalidating behavior. I'm still trying to be cognizant of this myself so that I'm not too forgiving in the future. P.S. I'm going to give one identifying demographic - I'm female. Just to bring attention to the queer community and so that people don't automatically assume I'm male because I mention an ex-gf. But yeah. Abuse and sexual harassment / assault happen between two women as well (and naturally, between other genders too).

Hello does anyone here suffer from depersonalization/ derealisation? Basically it is the feeling of disconnect from yourself and other and reality. Like watching a movie of yourself. People usually have similar feelings when high or drunk. From what I hear people usually get it from lack of social interaction/ being alone. I just got this a few weeks ago and it is the scariest thing ever. I look into the mirror and my family members and don't recognize them. It has made my stress levels and anxiety to skyrocket past what they already are and made it hard to eat and i am losing a lot of weight. Ive never though of myself as antisocial but I stopped socializing to many people so I could just focus on my schoolwork about a year ago. I got better grades and was eating better but now this happened and im scared to death. When I talk to people it gets slightly better but I dont know anyone well enough to have long conversations with over many days.(basically a friend). Would anyone out there who has or does not have this be willing to talk to me/ get lunch for a while or let me join there friend group to help me break out of this?(basically do friend things and talk and stuff) Im not one to write stuff like this but I am very scared and alone right now and I have no one else to turn to. Hopefully some bruins out there can help out a fellow bruin. And only comment if you want to actually help me because I really need help.

I love UCLA, I really do, But sometimes I feel like the heavy workload and the stress of being a premed has sucked all my individuality out of me. It's like I have lost the core parts of my identity because I spend so much of my energy just trying to stay afloat. I guess that's why I love North Campus majors so much. They have the passion and charisma that I and so many others around me have lost.

I wonder everyday if I am worth living. I knew I was a piece of shit. I have shitty personality, I am not smart, I am not good looking, and I am not a great person at all. Coming to college, I knew making friends would be hard and I knew especially someone with my shitty personality, I knew I wasnt going to make friends. It hurts though. I don't want to kill myself because I want to believe life will get better. I feel lonely, lost, betrayed, and unmotivated. I feel angry at myself because I cant grow faster enough to be a better individual.I also drown my thoughts by getting busy but that makes me fell worse. I also don't want to share this to my parents because they will worry and I don't want to share to my friends because my mental health problem seems so small. Does anyone know what to do?

To my fellow bruins suffering with depression and mental illnesses. Things will get better Let me tell you this is the biggest lie in the history of lies. People tell me this all the time--when I'm having suicidal thoughts, after a suicide attempt, and even when I'm strapped to a hospital bed. They've told me this after they learned how I was destroyed as a child by other people. They are wrong. Things are the same. What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to just forget about it. (what an ignorant idiot they are)) But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

I totally feel undocumented immigrants because I was badly treated once with the consideration that myself is undocumented. My fucking ------ roommate who mentioned something about deportation to me. She is a crazy bitch and mentioned about deportation. I left the place with penalty because I did not want to live there with the devil. Even though I receive financial aid, it does not mean that I am an undocumented. Also, even if I was DACA, my immigration status shouldn't be blackmailed.

I was dismissed from UCLA recently, and I feel like a part of me has died inside. I still pretend like everything is ok and when friends and family ask me about class I make up all of these elaborate lies. But the truth is I have nowhere to go. I fucked up to the point of no return. And I don't blame anyone or anything but myself. I brought this on myself. I just want everyone reading this to know that if you or someone you know is going through shit and its affecting your grades seek help NOW. Don't sit and ignore it like I did. Pls keep fighting. I promise to also seek help and fight as well. I wish us the best of luck. Love you <3

To the De Neve worker who has every right to be kinda pissed rn -- I swear I didn't look you in the eye and leave my plates for you to clear!! I was just gonna get a churro before I came back to take all my plates and go ): I feel so bad ily im sorry if you think im THAT PERSON that leaves all my playes on the table and goes i promise im not

I am suicidal since I got major depression and anhedonia from LSD/MDMA combo 2 months back. Ive been going to therapy and its useless. They do mindfulness acceptance exercises but its all pointless. The fact is--and I told my therapist this--that unless this resolves in another month or two im out of here and will just kill myself. I dont give any fucks about mindful this or mindful that or CBT this or CBT that. One fact is I will NOT and I REFUSE to deal with a mental health condition i did not have before. If I cannot live my life the way I did before the mental condition, then i will not live my life. I will say bye to all my friends and family and it will be a sad tragedy but tbh there is no point in living with this condition anyways. And Meds dont work either. I had a pretty bright future as an engineering major but no more. I will not be tolerating this much longer especially given that therapy isnt curing me. Therapy is actually making me more suicidal by giving me dumb mindfulness exercises. The fact is therapy does not cure this and if I do not get cured then i see no point in living. I had 0% anhedonia before and for me even a drop of anhedonia is too much anhedonia. Mathematically, that is infinitely more than before and thus unacceptable and I will just kill myself. Anyways--I still have some hope. Has anybody done any rapid antidepressant therapy to get rid of all the symptoms such as ECT (electroconvulsion therapy)? Im scared of memory loss but hey its better than suicide right? #uclasecretsmentalhealth

Does anyone else ever feel like you have a bunch of acquaintances, but nobody really wants to spend much time with you aside from a hello, maybe even a quick hug? Close relationships have always been hard to come by for me.I think I'm a decent person--that I'm generally kind, compassionate, and sensitive to the needs and emotions of others. Sometimes I even feel like I am a bit of an old soul in a sense because I am mature beyond my years in some ways even though I still have a slightly dirty sense of humor. Not to mention romantic relationships. I have never had a boyfriend and I am a couple of years older than most college seniors.I'm not extraordinarily gorgeous but I also think I am not terribly bad looking. Sometimes I feel like people don't like me, and I tell myself that it's just all in my head or I just haven't given them a chance to like me because I keep to myself too much. But other times I think it's true, that people really don't see much value in being my friend/don't like me. I think it's normal for everyone to have people that don't like them. But when does it reach the point at which so many people don't like you that there must be something wrong with you? That people never respond to your texts or emails--because they don't like you or because they're busy? Surely if you were somewhat important to them they would answer at some point. I guess what I'm trying to say is: How many people that don't like you does it take to prove that you're just not likable? Like maybe if it's a small group--maybe 5 people- that doesn't like you, then surely it's on them for not liking you--there's nothing wrong with you/your personality/your characteristics. But if a huge number of people dislike you, then doesn't that say something about you, not them? I know getting people to like you should never be the goal in life, but if none of your peers like you, if you have no friends--what to do? I often feel that I can go the whole day at school without speaking to anyone except maybe a few words. Maybe that's why I talk so much at home...  #uclasecretsfriends

I am an Econ major and I hate it. My parents pretty much forced me into this major. Whenever I tell them I want to change my major, they always threaten they will stop paying tuition for me. For some reason, they think Econ is about trading stocks and analyzing its graphs. In reality, it is very theoretical and Math intensive. All the models are based on unrealistic assumptions. I hope I don't fall apart before I graduate.  #uclasecretsannoying

I am a former bruin, Asian female, who is currently going to law school in a southern state. I really miss how inclusive UCLA was. Here, I often face subtle discrimination which just feels normal now. Two times in the beginning of this semester when I spoke in one of my small class, the professor very subtly ignored me and moved on. She acted as if she was responding to me but she actually talked about something completely different that I was very confused. Second time when it happened, she later addressed what I said during the class without addressing me, and criticized what I said (in a way saying such thing) and it was very apparent to other people that she was criticizing my action. Also, even though she encourages students who normally don't volunteer in the class to speak more, she ignores when I raise my hand and calls everyone else who usually dominates the class. That happened twice and I stopped bothering to raise my hand. Recently, I submitted a research summary about a topic that I am interested in for my final research paper, and she sent me an email saying I sound so knowledgeable and she is wondering if I already know a lot about the topic. It is very frustrating how my good faith effort in researching and putting time in choosing the topic is just going to be interpreted that way by the professor who is going to grade my work. I replied with the sources I used and told her that I do not actually know a lot but did not hear any response yet. It is frustrating because every other students think she is a very nice person and would not think that she is doing this. She was also very nice to me when I was in her office hour that I cannot tell if she does this intentionally/consciously. Last year, my Asian friend who was in her class experienced the same situation and reported her to three different officials at school but no one was willing to take an action. The student affairs dean told my friend that it will only put her at disadvantage and do nothing to the professor if she were to seek further action. I will probably go to the professor's office hour tomorrow to address her email and my research paper in general. Any suggestion on how I should talk during the office hour?  #uclasecretsquestion

So I got introduced to this girl while I was studying and she is just so adorable. The things she say and the dumb snaps I get from her make me want to just squeeze her. I would love to take her on a mini-golf date, and go get gelato afterwards :p  #uclasecretscrush

There was this cute boy with glasses sitting across from me in the Kerckhoff upstairs area today and I was dealing with a ton work and could not address the fact that I thought he was cute but shout out to you because you're a cutie and somebody should let you know <3 (11/06) #uclasecretscrush

To the guy who had the crush on the girl for 4 years but graduated: text her, ask her how shes doing, catch up? Who said long distance wasn't worth a shot? #uclasecretsrelationships

I have a friend who got dumped by a guy she liked over the summer and I'm really worried about her. She was getting over him at the beginning but she recently found out some gossip about him having a new girl now and that put her back at square zero. When you ask her about it she says that she is ok but she's really not. Something about her has changed and she's become obsessed about her weight. She's lost about 20 lbs and keeps talking about wanting to lose 20 more but she will be really thin then. She hasn't been eating much either and she used to love eating. I'm worried to the point where I've come close to messaging the guy and asking him to talk to her.

One thing that I'm too afraid to tell anyone is that my older brother took advantage of me growing up so now I've got commitment issues and trust issues. It just has a taken a great toll on me.. and I'm talking to someone but I don't think it will last bc I broke up with the last guy I really loved bc of my depression and whatnot. Which makes me even sadder hahhaha.. I try to laugh it off..

My roommate does not go out... at all. He does not talk either. Literally he stays in our room all day after class, even to-go his lunches from b cafe or somewhere and eat in here. Floormates don't know who he is either. Im kinda getting tired of him being antisocial.

Confession time: I don't think I've ever had a real crush/romantic interest in anyone. Doesn't really help that it took me a long time to understand what makes a person attractive, and that a person can be attractIVE to me without me being attractED. BUT I think I may have found both in this one person, at least in the aesthetic attractiveness and being attracted to the personality. I THINK. But I'm not sure? And we aren't like super close, but we've recently become better friends, and I can see myself having more romantic inclinations eventually? They are a genuinely good person, and I don't think I am giving them a halo effect. I don't know, IS THIS WHAT HAVING A CRUSH IS LIKE???

I swearrr you guys need to stop partying on the open area at the apartment near Strathmore and Levering every damn Thursday with loud music on until 3-4 am! At least get an closed area.... Y'all selfish little bastards. Can y'all just leave us in peace with the little sleep that we're getting during midterm weeks? Grow up with your lame parties I swearr! I'm calling the police. urggg

It's funny how all the guys I talk to think that all we girls want is to have sex with them... like I just wanna talk to be friends with you. Not to be a one night stand. Not even that, but at least have more than 1 conversation with me before you ask if I'm DTF. Honestly. wtf.

Why do I feel lonely even when I'm surrounded by people I love and who love me back? I'm not even sure what will satisfy me at this point. It's really rough being in an environment of constant affirmation while feeling like I'm missing out by not having a deeper connection to someone special. It's not that I'm ungrateful for everyone and everything that's good to me. I really don't think I am. I just don't know what exactly would help me feel better. All I know is that I don't have whatever that is yet.

During my freshman year I was incredibly lonely. I ate at the dining halls by myself, I didn't talk to anyone on my floor, and I never went out on the weekends or even on my birthday. I knew it was my fault for being so shy, but I always felt like I was doing college wrong because everyone else was going out and having so much fun. Things are better for me now, but I still remember what it was like to be that lonely, so whenever I recognize an acquaintance sitting by themselves in lecture, I try to sit with them, even if I have other friends in the class. Especially if they're transfer students, since I know that makes it so much harder. I know it's easy to feel lonely in a place like UCLA, but that's going to keep happening if we don't open ourselves to new people. If you have a clique or friend group, consider opening it up to a stranger that you like. Or if you want to get to know a classmate better, have you and your friends sit with them in lecture. You could be saving someone's life, or at the very least make someone's day. And even if they actually want to be alone and you're bothering them, they'll make it clear, and you can just brush it off and go back to the comfort of your friends. I'm a shy introvert and I hate talking to people, but I also hate the idea of someone feeling like they don't belong due to loneliness.

To all the freshmen/second years/ any-years thinking about how hard it is to make friends in college compared to high school: think about how you spent 8 hours a day at high school. Of course its easier to make friends with all the people stuck there w you for such a long time everyday!! My best advice is to join a club or team for something you really enjoy. I met some of my best friends when I joined a dance team!

Anyone else feel like they have a few friends but don't have anyone close? I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to like deep conversation wise Or even hangout on the weekend. Mainly Like 15min convos. Guess I have no real friends huh Just wanted to express myself anonymously since I can't really tell anyone how I feel. And no I don't think I'm depressed

I had a huge crush on one very special girl for the entirety of my four years at UCLA. We were friends but I knew I didn't stand a chance so I did nothing. I wasn't able to fall for another person and I thought it was because she was still around or at least physically close enough in my life. Now that I graduated and moved to another place I realized I have truly lost the ability to love.

My girlfriend recently broke up with me because she feels she needs more time to take care of herself and apparently I must have been doing something wrong because she went from telling me how I was the only guy who made her feel this way to leaving me. I am doing relatively ok now, but I feel hurt, I just wish people would say what they mean and when they make a commitment stick with it. I want her to do this if this is the best thing for her, but it seems like she should have known earlier. I am thinking this may not be a juicy enough secret to get posted, but this girl meant so much to me, the only girl I have wanted for all of 2017 and my heart breaks because I feel like we went from being great friends to her being upset at me when I did nothing. It is too bad that she will never know the full extent of what she meant to me, she saved my life several times. If she somehow ever sees this I want her to know I am not mad, just sad at how everything ended.

I'm taking a class with a really young professor (he's 31) and I've developed the hugest crush on him. I'm 24 and I haven't even had a crush on anyone since I was like, 17. He's exactly the kind of guy I would have asked out if we'd met in a different setting. Now I'm wondering, once the quarter is over and the grades are posted, would it be appropriate for me to ask him out?? Or would he think I'm a complete idiot? I like him so much it's ridiculous...

Don't know if it's the American culture - it seems a very big deal when you talk to an opposite sex. This is the convo happened between me and a friend the other day. me: Hey what's you up to :) guy: You keep talking to me. I'm not into dating you though, sorry. I felt so attacked. I genuinely care about people it's not a matter of romantic or not romantic. When we were children, we can hit each other up, go to the park and not worry about things like this. Wish people could let loose & not make everything about dating.

I'm honestly surprised after what happened in Las Vegas and the extent of that horrific tragedy, nothing happened at all afterwards except lower morale. No changes to policies or laws, not even a well-known, national public discussion as for ways to prevent future mass murders. Gun control (stricter or more relaxed) shouldn't be the only issue of discussion here. Mental health is another. Psychology third. We should be understanding the thought processes behind these murderers and why they believe in killing. We should be looking for ways to dispel that wicked and demented belief at every opportunity. Take a look at today (November 5th) in Texas. 25+ more innocent lives gone. Millions more will have to go to their Sunday services or other places of worship with the unnecessary fear of being attacked. Security will be tightened, our freedoms possibly further restricted, and the process repeats itself again unfortunately. How much longer do we have to go through this before someone finally calls for a public debate in looking for legislative answers to mass murders?

I just really want to be friends with this person that's pretty reserved. They have a close group of friends partly bc they play a sport and so they're with each other 24/7. However, this person is the one who reached out and seemed to have wanted to be friends in the first place. Yet now they don't ever reach out or really communicate and I'm not sure if I'm being annoying by trying to talk to them. I really do want to be friends you seem like a cool person!!! I guess I'll be just around if you want to hang  #uclasecretsfriends

My internship supervisor just rejected being a recommender although she praised my work during the internship. Now I don't know what to do. It is so hard to keep hope in life when you lose sth. that you thought you got it. #uclasecretsconfessions #uclasecretshope

Honestly since coming to college, I've really stopped feeling any emotions. Bottling up my emotions has been a way of coping with the stressors of life but it's reached a point where its not healthy. No one knows I'm hurting, no one knows I'm stressed and sometimes I don't even know if I'm hurting or stressed. There's not a lot of things that trigger an emotional response such as happiness or sadness. I almost got jumped and I didn't even feel a thing. My emotions are neutral but I have rbf so everyone thinks I'm mad or angry. They tell me to smile more but I can't smile if I don't really feel anything. I can still empathize with people but its difficult to express my own emotions or even know if I am feeling anything. This stoicism makes it hard to connect with people because I either come off as cold and unfeeling or an arrogant asshole. Thoughts? #uclasecretsemotions #uclasecretsstress

Random question, but I don't know where else to ask it - has anyone else noticed a trend of memes that are videos but could easily be images? As in they're just images with a very subtle special effect going on in the background? What are they trying to do, use up all our data? #uclasecretsmemes

I ate alone a ridiculous amount of times the past two years and it is great because you don't have to force conversation while simultaneously chewing food, you get some time alone to yourself at this insanely crowded school, and you can go at your own pace and leave whenever you want to and not have to deal with planning out when/where to meet with flaky college people. Ya'll need to learn how to be ok being alone, jesus.  #uclasecretsalone #uclasecretspreference

'If you're no good in bed, there's nothing good about you. You're not smart, you're not good looking. Honestly, why am I still with you?' Do not pressure us into things if we do not want to. Especially if we said so before. I lost my virginity 5 years ago, and the stigma is that guys can't be raped. Well, trust me. I definitely didn't enjoy it, and it affects my relationships to this day. Coerced consent isn't consent, no means no, and consent is revocable. #MeToo #uclasecretsconsent #uclasecretsconfession

My friend from high school just started school at UCLA this year. During first week, we were hanging out pretty much every day and I felt like we were getting really close. I even began to develop feelings for her. But she just suddenly stopped hanging out with me and I'm not sure why. Every time I asked her to go to dinner or just study together, she would turn me down. I've been feeling pretty depressed about it and it seems like she just doesn't think I'm fun to be around anymore. I talked to her about it on Facebook (I wanted to in person, but she always makes excuses to not meet up), but she just acts like nothing is wrong, when clearly something has changed. I don't know what I should do. I really care about her, but it doesn't seem like she has the same feelings toward me. #uclasecretsfriend #uclasecretschange

someone very close to me died recently and anytime i hear words to do with death or dying or even when someone makes a joke about wanting to die im immediately triggered and can't get it out of my mind.. i feel like this is going to be on my mind all year and i really need help but I don't know where to start :( i am not ok  #uclasecretstrigger #uclasecretsdeath

I have lingering PTSD from years of abuse that my friends don't know about. Because of this, sometimes I react in unexpected ways at their behavior, then they laugh at it or jokingly chastise me for it. I know they mean well and it's not their fault, but it still makes me feel a little hurt, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't want them to feel hyperconscious or bad about it either :/ #uclasecretsfriends #uclasecretsconfessions

This is my first year, and I still haven't made friends. Everyone told me over the summer: become BFFs with your roommates, join clubs, make study groups, talk to your floormates, chill with your professors... But my roommates hang out with their high school friends, I don't know anyone in the clubs I go to or my classes, I somehow live on the most antisocial floor on campus, and there's a giant-ass crowd at the end of every class to even talk to my professors. Every time I text someone I barely met, they either ghost me or it turns out they already have plans with their real friends, and I only feel more and more like an annoying acquaintance they're tired of dealing with. I don't think I'll ever have friends like I did in high school, and I'm terrified of being the only loner in what seems to be a truly social campus. #uclasecretsfriends

Recently, I've been having to tell myself to not make permanent decisions based on hopefully temporary feelings. I've been having to tell that to myself every single day lately. The only reason why I haven't done it is because of my parents. Other than that, I don't care anymore.  #uclasecretsthoughts

He claimed that he wanted to talk to me about a club he was in. I obliged to a dinner at a dining hall. He was a true conversationalist, but he was bitter. He had hatred in the way he talked about humans, and he was hung up about the past. Somehow we ended up in my floor's lounge, and he started making moves on me. He slid his hand down my leg. I didn't do anything. I was shocked. At that point I was naive and did not know to put my guard up around guys. I just wanted to talk. He manipulated me into my room. We had sex. I didn't want to. This began two surreal months, as I continued to sleep with my abuser and I became more and more depressed and stuck in an abusive spiral. He was obsessed with a past girl that he had slept with. She had a boyfriend then. He probably manipulated her too. He would talk about how she was the one, how she was his soulmate, and I would listen. He claimed she was still into him. I don't know why I did, but I tried hard to empathize with him as I hurt inside. He put me down, he belittled my abilities, my opinions, and idealist tendencies. He had delusions of grandeur. He was going to be one of the greats, he would leave a legacy on humanity. He thought everyone was stupid. He once flashed and held a pocket knife against throat as I struggled against him. It was just a joke. I finally broke in the end. I told him I can't do this anymore. He didn't say anything. He raped me again that night. #metoo #uclasecretsrape

People told me to think my recent relationship as a good experience and learn from it. It is true and I should, but I cannot stop wishing I never met the person. All of the memories I can remember are painful and sorrowful. I get angry on how I was treated and to think how much the person is enjoying life. You know, I should've never met you. I don't need the memories, just get away from my life please. I told you I am happy that I met you - sorry now to think of it without the love I once had, you were just a very very bad person in my life.  #uclasecretsmemories #uclasecretsrelationships

Being an underachiever, I can't tell how much the Simpsons episode 'Bart Gets An F' gets to me whenever I watch it. Studying all night and stocked on adderall in a ridiculously competitive class, I go to the final thinking that I'm going to ace it and this is literally the very best that I can do, that I cannot top this performance. Maybe my parents will understand that. I come out of the final and feel satisfied about it, and am pretty happy I got done with it after all this hardwork. Then I get to when the results are announced, in a week or two. I barely come near an 80 and with the curve I'm lucky so I get a B-. What do I say? What did I do wrong? I did everything I could, but here I am. Interviewers will look at this and spout the usual but if you're really interested in the material, it would show in your grades or at least make that face when they see your GPA. Is it my poor attention? I'm not sure, but when things like this keep subtly telling you that you're disappointing, it starts to get to you. I never got close to a 3.5, heck even a 3.2. IFYP Bart

I seek solace in reading success stories of people who had rough circumstances but managed to be really successful in the end. I do this because I graduated with a 2.5 GPA & no internships from UCLA and I occasionally I have that depressing day when all I could think about are all the opportunities that are lost and can no longer pursue (grad school....). I made my mistakes back in the day, but today, I am much more mature and I have come to learn that the true recipe to any form of success is self-discipline. A combination of lack of discipline and having no clue what future I wanted for myself is what put me into this mess. Don't be like me and screw up, because you'll certainly run into roadblocks and work much harder in the end (and have depressing days like me today lol). Study, even if you don't feel like it; go workout, even if you don't feel like it; go to office hours, even if you don't feel like it. It's ALWAYS going to be a battle between that voice inside your head saying, I can do it later, and you, the TRUE decision maker. Try to think of that voice in your head as if it was someone else trying to tell you what to do and doing the complete opposite because you ain't no lil bitch and nobody is going to tell you what to do but you lol. Reaching a true level self-discipline means being able to ignore that voice in your head that is constantly saying maybe later and instead getting to work and putting in 200% of your effort into it, even if you feel like utter crap doing it. Forget about motivation too--motivation is fleeting and fickle, discipline is dependable and reliable. Finally, although not completely related, but here's my favorite quote for the past few weeks: “It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” (stop fkn caring what other people think of you and do whatever makes you feel confident and great...but also never forget to always be nice to other people haha) uclasecretsthoughts

Can anyone give me some advice: I am a 4th year MIMG major with a 3.0GPA. I've always wanted to become a doctor. I used to be a great student until I came to UCLA. I used to know how to manage time, I used to know how to get great test scores.. And now I am empty because I feel that I am a different person. I feel I have no way of getting into med school with my 3.0 GPA while fellow classmates have 3.8's with stellar MCAT scores applying. All I have are a few volunteering experiences and 3 years of experience working as an employee in Reagan MC. I haven't even taken MCATS because I feel like I won't even qualify, and it will set me back about $5-10k for med school expenses to end up not getting accepted. Any advice, comments, experiences welcome #uclasecretsadvice

I mentally buried and justified my molester for over ten years because I didn't want to believe that I was a person who could be repeatedly molested. Hey, maybe he was just tickling me. Well, it's not as bad as rape, so I can't tell anyone about it. I'm sure he didn't mean any harm, right? Now I'm suffering the effects of those justifications as I try to piece together my memories and move on.  #uclasecretssupport

When do people usually meet their best friends or even friends in college? I'm also a second year and still haven't met mine and I feel like my loneliness is affecting my mental health a lot. #uclasecretslonely

Last Thanksgiving my cousin's new wife, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white girl called me and the rest of my Mexican family racist cuz we said white privilege exists. It takes a lot of white privilege to be white and call minorities racist. #cringegiving.

I had a lovely Thanksgiving with my family until my mom brought up how Die Hard was her favorite Christmas movie. We spent literally an hour and a half in an argument over whether or not it is a holiday movie (it totally is), which ended in my family and I storming out of my cousin's house. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! #CringeGiving.

To the well-dressed boy who approached me at the edge of Washington Square Park on November 6th: I've never had anyone run after me just to politely introduce themselves, tell me they noticed me walking through the park, and that I looked pretty — that might just be one of the sweetest encounters with a stranger I've ever had. I was actually having an overwhelmingly stressful day, and your thoughtful gesture really cheered me up! I greatly admire your courage (bolder than anything I could ever manage) and appreciate how courteous you were throughout our short conversation. Usually the type of guy to approach me is a serious creep, an asian fetishist, or someone who makes me feel unsafe walking around at night, so it was incredibly refreshing to meet someone so genuine and endearing. As I mentioned (and I hope you didn't think I was lying to try to get out of anything), I do have a boyfriend of 4 years, and didn't feel it was appropriate to give you my number or stay in contact in any way. But I just felt horrible for leaving so suddenly (I was flustered and thought it was a prank/dare!) and wanted to get this message to you somehow. You seemed like a stellar guy and, objectively, you are also super good looking! Your next girlfriend found a keeper! Wishing you the best.

Guess our professor forgot about daylight savings, cuz he took a look at his watch at 1 and said all right, looks like we're out of time! (class ends at 2) The entire class just looked at each other with that do we tell him look, then we all got up and left and honestly I've never felt this level of community at NYU ever before.

can someone please explain what purpose nyu's multi factor authentication is supposed to serve besides being really frustrating.

Went to the doctor today and apparently I have all of the symptoms (obvious and messed known) of being pregnant. Waiting for the bloodwork. Checked recently about my thyroid so that's not the issue. I feel like I should be freaking out because it's literally impossible for me to be pregnant but honestly I'm more excited to see how much it would freak a bunch of racists out to find out that Jesus came from an Asian.

Last weekend, I hosted a halloween party, when friends went into my room to get something, found my American Whopper dildo instead, brought it outside into the living room and started tossing it around. By the end of the night, people were using it as microphones, trying to get the suction end to stick on the ceiling, and covering it in glitter makeup. It was all fine, until the next day, I noticed it was gone. My roommates and I turned our entire apartment upside down, and we still couldn't find it. it's been a week now, and we still have no idea where it is. Tl;dr Somebody stole my dildo, and I have no idea what to do with my life now.

I like when my boyfriend calls me mommy in bed. Makes me feel like I'm finally the one in control... is that something I should be ashamed of? Like it's not about my mom or anything, just a feeling i get, you know?

My freshman year roommate was such an extreme nudist. Always naked, dong in your face. He even used to jerk off with the door open. Like welcome to fucking NYU.

I think I have a crush on one of Andrew Hamilton's bodyguards.I keep running into him on campus and at events. I particularly find the one with black hair kind of cute, and I keep seeing him around but I never get a chance to strike up a conversation with him that lasts for longer than 30 seconds. I didn't even get to ask for his name. Please help a girl out, im just tryna find love

I'm afraid to come out to my parents because I'm worried they'd stop paying my tuition just because I'm gay.

As a man, I have been sexually assaulted by a woman in the past. I have wanted to join the #MeToo movement for some time now, but I'm afraid I'll be ridiculed or berated. Every time I have told a friend about my experience I have always been told “It's not a big deal, she was probably just messing around” or “well if she was hot, then why is it a problem?” Sexual assault is sexual assault, and I should be able to come clean about my experiences without being told they're not real.

Running 2 hours past the “incident” in Lower Manhattan and still haven't received any text from NYU. You ghosting us, Public Safety?

Me: I'm a strong independent woman and no man can ever make me feel small. Also me: Choke me harder. (This secret was brought to you by daddy issues)

Growing up, my parents at best, were emotionally neglectful and at worst, emotionally abusive. Since then, I've been forced to fend for myself in terms of providing myself emotional and mental support. I'm thankful they're paying for my college education but I sometimes wish they weren't. Aside from supporting me financially, which I greatly appreciate and am so thankful for, they constantly berate me, are condescending, and blame me for things that aren't my fault. I wish I could cut them off, but I know that I can't. Is it bad I'm sticking around just for the free tuition?

If you have a laptop don't sit in a seat with a computer in the library just to use the laptop instead. My broke ass family can't afford me a laptop and the desktops are EVERYTHING at school.

I hate my body. It faces a wage gap, underrepresentation in corporate boardrooms and poliitics, and stigma in society. Little kids watch Disney movies grow up learning that main characters don't look like me. Adults watch movies learning that, too. I was going to specify which trait I'm talking about, but it doesn't matter. Just know there's a whole underbelly of isms that aren't talked about or stigmatized, but still damage lives.

Sometimes when I'm in Bobst I'll pretend I have to take a call or something just so I can talk to the cute girl next to me and ask her to watch my stuff for a few minutes. Anything to break the ice right?

Tonight, I'm going out and am playing a drinking game - take a shot for every Pickle Rick, sexy Pennywise, or Wonder Woman I see. Let's hope I don't die. Happy Halloween, fam!

I read the secret about the Comic Sans font and literally felt stabbed in my heart. This makes me feel like I care too much about aesthetic and reminded me of this: I broke up with my last boyfriend because I met him during the winter but summer came around and he started wearing cargo shorts. I literally felt less attracted to him and couldn't continue on. I feel like I need help because I'm too shallow.

Today, I had two of my best friends respectively cut me off. The first one told me he never cared about me, and the second one told me I was selfish, even though I comforted him after he sexually assaulted me. I can't tell if I'm unlucky or the world's worst person.

I think my bobst crush finished midterms and I'm low-key kind of upset

I said a dude was handsome once like 2 weeks ago and now all my friends are literally pressuring me into being gay. They say things like maybe you just don't know it yet or why don't you just try it?. Um maybe cuz I don't like men? I know they're trying to be supportive especially in this new social climate but enough is enough. I know I'm def not the most masculine guy and I've def had people mistake me for gay before, but if I say I'm not gay I'm not fucking gay and people need to stop needling me about it.

I found out I had genital herpes the other day. I went home last weekend crying and told my mother, who is my best friend, that I thought my life was over and that I'd never orgasm ever again. Today, I got an email from my dorm that I had a package. My mother sent me a vibrator.

I'm a straight guy and I'm legitimately confused as to what I'm supposed to be doing to support feminism in response to the me too movement. I feel like if I continue to just listen like they ask me to do then I get scrutinized for not taking any action, but then when I try to speak out in favor of faminsim, or actively try to promote the ideals and beliefs, I'm seen as a pseudo-feminist who isn't really able to understand what I'm talking about. I've talked to my female friends about ideas that I have to try to make a change and all I get is conflicting opinions saying that I shouldn't try to do anything as it would draw attention away from what matters, but then I constantly hear that it's time for men to do something. That's all I want to do, is to do something that will show women that men understand and are there to help without coming off as fake or taking the attention away from the issue at hand. Women, I'm on your side and I want to do something, but I just don't know what to do.

I'm a Jew and I'm pro-Palestine. As much as I want to get involved with SJP, I can't because my family will disown me. I wish that more people would realize how intertwined this issue has become to Judaism itself. In hebrew school, we learned that Palestinians were evil murderers. Anyone who even asked for the other side of the story was severely punished. I hate that I feel like I have to choose between my Jewish identity and my political beliefs.

Today I was studying for an exam in the Gallatin building when I needed to pee. I opened one of the bathroom doors to find a couple vigorously fucking. Glad ya'll found an outlet to handle to stress of miderms!

I was drunk at a friend's house. Her roommate - a boy - offered to take me upstairs to his bedroom so I could sleep. He said he would sleep on the couch downstairs. But still, I wouldn't go with him until my other friend - a girl - went with me to make sure I was ok. In the morning, I woke up and almost apologized to my friend's roommate because I felt I had made him feel awkward. But I didn't apologize to him. While I'm sure he had no intention to harm me, I had no guarantee of that because as a woman, I've been conditioned to fear men's actions. I'm thankful for my friend's roommate for being kind. He's a sweet guy. But if I had a dollar for every time a sweet guy turned out to be not so sweet, well, I'd obviously be very, very rich. No more apology culture. Men, you've made this name for yourselves. Now fucking fix it.

I don't like judging people's choices, but it really sucks to walk by a smoker because I have asthma. Whenever I'm stuck walking behind or standing next to someone who's smoking and my throat starts to seize up, I can't help hoping karma gets them back later.

This week, my girlfriend broke up with me, I lost my job, learned my best friend is moving far away after this semester and have a terrible cold, but somehow my makeup has managed to stay perfectly in tact even throughout the hours of crying, so I guess all is well?

My professor asked my class if anyone wants to teach her morning class so she can get drunk tonight. I'm inspired.

There's a restaurant called Bowlin across the street from the silver center. I eat there everyday just to see the muscular, super hot man who is in charge of making the bowls. Please bowl me if you know what I mean

I had sex on my roommate's bed and basically my partner and I both came all over my roommate's un-sheeted pillow. I re-covered his pillow and last night my roommate mentioned that his pillow smelled especially nice for some reason, oops

i'm too scared to post that on my actual facebook because i'm still facebook friends with the guy and i know he doesn't remember that day the same way i do

I got into a section of a language class where everyone else is from the same class beforehand, and I'm not into side talks during class (it wastes the professor's time, and my money that I'm paying for the class). So I made a brilliant plan of doing a social experiment where I act like a complete asshole Sternie stereotype just in that class to gauge my classmates' reactions, like making all my answers business related. It's been entertaining as hell so far. I noticed that LS and Tisch students react/laugh at me the most, where CAS students are the most neutral. I look forward for my class every day to be the best asshole. It's fantastic.

A few months ago, I was sexually assaulted. I was heartbroken, disappointed and for some time, unsure of how to cope. Long story short, I decided to channel my anger and sadness into many of the mental health/wellness initiatives I've launched through this page, in the hopes that they would maybe help someone who had experienced something similar. If you've ever been sexually harassed, sexually assaulted or raped, please know that you're never alone, that time heals all wounds, and that help is out there.

Fml right now. I've been slacking off in school for the past four years because I thought that one day I would inherit close to a billion dollars in assets from my dad. Come to find out the fool just had another child at the age of 67 with his 20 year old mistress, who I am now probably going to share my inheritance with. Now instead of everything going to me it's more than likely going to be split three ways. This is so messed up, idk what to do.

In my culture, it's standard for a son to give his first month's payment to his mom. I live at home and it's something my older brother did, and so did my dad with his mom. It honestly felt pretty crappy to do the wire transfer, since my parents recently just spend money freely and I know they're just going to use it to buy some more shit we don't need. I'm scared that this first payment will become standard, as proof that I am capable of continuously paying for my parents while I live under their roof. I'm even more scared I'll never be able to save up enough (exactly why I stayed at home in the first place after graduating) to move out somewhere worthwhile. Why should I feel obligated to do so much more for my parents than they ever did for theirs?. (This secret was brought to you by daddy issues)

I'm a commuter student and I live with my parents in their apartment on the Upper East Side. Last night, I brought home my boyfriend, thinking my parents wouldn't be home until late. After a few drinks, me and the guy start hooking up in the living room and things get really steamy. Literally the moment I yell out Oh yes, daddy! the front door swings open and my father, who doesn't know I'm gay walks in. We haven't spoken since. FML.

If you were ever thinking about taking exams at the Moses center, I discourage you to do so. The environment is horrible and you are constantly being watched on cameras. They have falsely accused me of cheating twice. Their justification? I dropped a napkin and that apparently looked suspicious on cameras. I now have to deal with a number of staff members to prove my innocence. How are they helping people with learning disabilities if all they are doing is alleviating anxiety? The same goes for the Wellness exchange. The amount of times I have been dismissed, told to sleep on it etc. Seriously NYU. If you were easier to sue, I would be a fucking billionaire.

As a proud Sternie who sees the anti-Stern sentiment on this page and feels incredible sad about it ... why does everyone hate us? We're following our passions, just like the rest of you. A majority of us came here to learn about business so that we can try to do good and make a difference in the world in the ways that we can - is that so bad?

I was in my friend's room when I asked him what he was dressing up as for Halloween. He pulls out all of his Stern branded things: water bottle, shirt, hoodie, duffle bag, hat and a couple of stickers. Me: 'you're going as a Sternie?' Him: 'Nah an obnoxious prick'

To the OP who anonymously sent in a secret last night about a professor who allegedly sexually harassed multiple students who tried reporting it twice to no avail - I just got off the phone with the president's office and a few other people in an attempt to report it. If you feel comfortable, please DM the page for details. Let me know if you have any questions, or if there's anything else I can do to help you. Thanks.

A random drunk girl climbed in through my open window from my fire escape and asked if she could use my bathroom. Keep in mind that I was ass naked at the time and my fuck buddy was balls deep inside me. She did ask how the sex was, which was nice.

My quiet, religiously conservative roommate got a girlfriend a few weeks ago. They hang out in our room a lot which is fine, they're pretty chill, and the first time he asked about her staying over I thought nothing of it, having heard his spiel about his faith and devotion to celibacy until marriage. Fast forward to last night when I wake up at 3am to take a piss, and hear creaking bedsprings and muffled, awkward moans from 5 feet away. Never in my life have I wished harder for a Polaroid camera, because I would've framed the look of sheer horror in his moonlit eyes.

Am I the only one who thinks the new security guard at Bobst is super hot? He stands on the left side of the lobby in the morning/ early afternoon looking so damn fine in his uniform, and he's always got that serious ‘I ain't letting anyone in this god damn library without their NYU ID card' face. Now I only enter Bobst from the left side in the morning/afternoon just so I can make eye contact with him.

I still don't know why they put the Wellness Expo in front of Stern. Like, I obviously wouldn't be in Stern if I gave two shits about my mental health.

I've been dating a girl for almost two years now. I'm a mixed-race POC and she's aryan as fuck. Today, after acting oddly standoffish and squeamish for a few months, she left me, saying that she just couldn't date someone who was non white anymore, because apparently there are things POC can't understand. I'm livid and heartbroken and entirely disappointed. I really thought I was going to spend my life with this girl, and over the span of a few months, she turns into a white nationalist. Why does it take so long for some people's true colors to come out?

Being celibate in this school (and college in general) has been rougher than I anticipated. My friends constantly base conversations on sex stories, and I can't do much else other than nod and smile. People either tease me or respect me for keeping my virginity. Experiences on dating apps haven't been the best, since delayed sex or no sex doesn't sit well with most people. It's come to the point where I don't even want to bother with dating anymore. This isn't a knock on sexually-active people -- all the power to y'all. I don't plan on changing my stance, but I can't help but feeling like an outsider, socially and romantically.

Last semester my professor told us during our second to last class that we need to email our final papers to her as class is cancelled because she is having her baby. We all were soooo shook and literally thought she was joking. Plot twist, she was pregnant the entire time. I was sipping the coffee that made me late (meme reference) and actually choked on it. The class tried to backtrack and act like we knew, but it we were too far gone. She literally said, “I can't believe you guys thought I was just fat.” Sis tried to play it off, but when she was grading our final papers she definitely took each of our reactions into account. Moral of the story is: if a professor is making an announcement, put all liquids down.[.C]
Sounds like you're better off without her. She sounds like a terrible human being at heart and her true colors emerged. I hope you find someone more deserving of your affection

Could we have feast on weekends?

Would anyone be interested in getting together and forming a drum circle club? It would be super fun to get a weekly thing going but I don't know many other people who would be interested.  #uclasecretsclub

First of all if you decided to almost kill urself only after being rejected by a school, you gotta reevaluate your life. Happy for you but you got issues

First mistake: when you're being involved with the community and other work opportunities it should be because you're personally interested in participating not for a resume boost!! Second mistake: you're privilege just to have the opportunity to study at a UC when many other people don't. But glad you made the best of your situation and found "happiness" wherever you be at. Go Bears!!!

That is quite the story

I'm married and eloped. Most of his family and our friend don't know. If you need someone to talk too, I'm here!

It is very brave of you to share the bad things happened to you and expressed your emotion entirely. Childhood does have a big influence on your mental health. You are not alone, many people have gone through Cal with depression, like me as a psych major. i was lucky to have friends who know about depression or went through similar problems together. not everyone could understand symptoms of depression and say things to make u feel better, but they do want to help you (except your Dad who might make it worse) try to talk to anyone from psych major, im sure they are, or even i am, happy to talk with you. Make good use of Tang Center, and campus counselling services like Student to Student Peer Counselling, they are on phone or in person. :) Go little Cal Bear, you will be great!

Whatever you do, don't "just wait" for people to change-they never do! (At least not in the ways you are expecting). Ask yourself what your requirements are for a relationship. Once your standards for quality time, affection, communication, reliability, commitment, etc. are met, it won't matter who is initiating what. A secure relationship allows a person to stop keeping score of everything that happens because you generally feel safe, satisfied, and wanted.

That is unfortunate that your family isn't giving you the support you need. Sexual assaults are the lowest reported crimes because the victim is often ashamed or embarrassed. It is not your fault, people who sexually assault others are the scum of the earth. I was molested when I was a child and still get haunted from it even though it happened almost 10 years ago. It has affected me ever since it happened and will more than likely be that way forever. It isn't something that is easy to forget. My advice for you is to join support groups and talk about it, get your feelings out and try to become comfortable with them. I know talking about it brings up the memories, but it helps. I'd be willing to talk if you ever wanted to. Try to keep your head up.

U are a very brave and strong person who stood up and talked to your mom and brother about it. I have helped many people in past recovering from these kind of situations. If you need assistance feel free to get in touch. Remember better late than never. You have a long long life to go.

When I got into Berkeley, I was extremely excited and felt as though I deserved my admission based on my hard work in HS. However, when I actually got to Berkeley, I realized that the majority of my peers are WAAAAY smarter than me....but, who cares?? You got in, stick out your four years, and get UC Berkeley under your belt. I thought the admissions committee was on crack for accepting me after I finished my first semester, but I stuck it out. You obviously have something in you that makes you worthy of being a golden bear. Perseverance is all it takes.. (BTW, I had to look up how to spell "perseverance") :) You got this!

1) I'm not a genius in any way, shape, or form. 2) You must be a genius if you got accepted for Fall 2015! Those apps haven't even come out yet. Impressive, my friend. 3) All joking aside, excellent choice.

Get a hobby where you meet new, awesome people.

Ya!! Hit me up too:) finding the right spot can be tricky, but you definitely will

You can always throw up after eating right? No more guilt

While this sentiment is nice, it's also important to realize that women are people too and not to put them on a pedestal

Given the times you prefer, and liking empty shops, couldn't you go say half an hour before they shut?

I don't like mornings either, and don't like busy shops, so I go to the supermarket at 2130-2230, and even though a busy supermarket, it empty.

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

I would say that it is entirely normal to have 'crushes' it's just just important to be aware that we cannot truly have any more than that as someone looking from a distance. Love can only really come from physical interaction and really knowing a person. Sure, we could obsess over them, but that isn't real because we don't actually know the person; they could be vile in reality, and if we base how we feel about them from the projections they make on social media or in the news, then we only get a filtered version of them, one that is unlikely to reveal any of the bad points about them. So, this would probably fall under 'idealisation' in that you see an ideal person, partly because that is all you're allowed to see and partly because that has become what you want to see. I am guessing that you follow them on social media and the like, so a start would be to break the habit of checking in on them, replacing this behaviour with something else more beneficial. Remind yourself that you don't know that person and that it would be far healthier to focus on 'real world' women and working towards meeting and getting to know someone in that way

I could be wrong but it sounds similar to OCD. I have something similar where I constantly say a sentance over and over in my head to the point where I feel I can't breath and I get really upset. It sounds like you are really suffering and I hope you can find a way to accept the songs so that they just play in the background.. not easy thought. My heart goes out to you x

im so sorry you were let down you can trust this forum though i promise please talk about your feelings here it is not good to bottle them up lots of love Lu xxxx

I'm sorry this has happened to you write. It is really hard to recover when you've trusted and opened up to therapists only to be let down in the end. I am in a similar situation with my psychologist. Took me ages to trust him, opened up to him about stuff I've never talked about to anyone else, cried myself through very difficult therapy, only for him to throw it all back in my face. He knows I have trust issues especially when it comes to men, because of my past, and he proved me right. I really don't know how you can move on from this, I'm hoping to meet up with an advocate after I've finished treatment to try and find a way forward. Not the same when the trust has gone though is it? I hope you can sort something out xxxx

Hi. As someone with a lot of anxiety, I completely get how crappy it feels to start a new job. Trying to learn the job duties along with gauging the personalities of all the new people you are working with can be overwhelming. Its possible that your participation was listed as optional, because they didn't want to make you feel pressured to attend a birthday lunch for/with people you don't know very well. At least that's what it sounds like to me. My company did a secret santa type thing in my department and gave me the option not to participate, due to only having been in this job for about four months or so (and I normally work night shifts so I don't have a ton of interaction with my coworkers). That's just my two cents on the situation, I hope it helps!

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

I am so sorry for what you and your family have experienced. I haven't had that type of experience, but I have suffered from PTSD. The more you talk about it, the better. But I would encourage you to speak with a counselor, someone who specializes in trauma. The rest of your life doesn't have to be lived in fear. I believe your story is miraculous. It sounds like God heard you. I believe if you ask Him to help you overcome the trauma, He'll hear you again and answer. I was led to speak to a counselor, and they helped tremendously. Then I continued to attend seminars to learn more about overcoming my past. It's a process, but God is faithful. I've experienced so much healing, and I don't doubt you will as well. Let us know how it goes. We're here with you.

This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

I feel okay. Like John Nash, I accept that my hallucinations are not real. They are not real people. So I can let them disappear in the distance. Do you think you could be projecting your feeings about breaking up with the child's mom onto the boy ?? Transferring your feelings onto a 7 month old baby is truly bad for the child. This is your son and he looks up to you. He is the wellspring of love. Let that love infect your being.  Adjusting to the idea that you are a parent for life, that is a big adjustment. No wonder you can't eat or sleep, this was a surprise for you, not a planned event.

You have been in this position a long time and it will feel shocking to you to be assertive with her. She is being very selfish. Your school work is work enough. When she is verbally abusive to you, you are old enough now to stop pleasing her and tell her instead that you do not deserve to be treated that way. And walk out of the house after you tell her that you do not deserve to be treated that way. Do not do the chores if she verbally abuses you. If you treat me that way, I won't help you at all. You can stand up to her. You are not her little girl anymore. Doing this will feel foreign to you. But she is being very bossy and unkind to a perfect daughter. I tried to get my mother's understanding and approval for years before I realized I wasn't going to get it.

You are a young adult and need your own space, especially with going to med school. You might need to sit down with mom and have a heart to heart talk with her. Explain how difficult med school is and the amount of work required to be successful. She might also need to come to realize that all work and no play is a formula for failure. Remember it is her house and she is doubling as a landlord. It is a difficult situation for both of you.Perhaps you can agree on some things you can do around the house that would be acceptable to both of you. Be firm , loving and prepared when you approach her. Be sure to choose a good time for both of you where you are both relaxed and open to the conversation.

I am so sorry. It must have been devastating for you. So heart breaking. Thinking of you. xxxx I just hope your post here makes at least one person think twice before acting and can save a life.

My brother killed himself a few years ago. I don't keep track of the date. But losing a child is a whole nother level of heartbreak. I know I was devastated when my GF lost our baby at 3 months. But having actually having had known him and loving him for so many years then losing him cannot be easy. Just try and remember the good times you shared.

Hi, you seem to enjoy things like computers and board games. Do you see this as a good thing or a bad thing? I think it is good to spend your free time doing what you enjoy. Even if other people think it's weird. Maybe you can meet people while you play board games at cafes and other public places. If they enjoy it you can talk to them about it. I think people need relationships in order to feel good. Good luck, don't give up.

I'm sorry you've been struggling, I would advise that you go to your GP as soon as possible. If the racing thoughts get too much go to A/E or contact out of hours or 111 if your in the UK. Many mental health conditions have racing thoughts. Are you sleeping? I agree the headache could be from tension/stress. Have you tried any paracetamol did it help? Hope you feel better very soon. Take care

When I had severe headaches, I fixed it by an improved diet, eating less sugar, and drinking more water, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine. A magnesium deficiency can be related to hallucinations and insomnia.

That's beside the point, I need to be here for a number of reasons. I'm just curious about the behaviour

this is my problem please help me

i feel so depressed i dont know what to do. How do you cope with depression

i am very depressed. how do you cope with depression. please help me. i feel so lost

i have depression. My depression is very bad. What do i do? i feel so sad all the time. I need a cookie.

Want (new) emotionally close people to hurt me physically: So I thought it was a common thing, but to my surprise Google did not think like that. Whenever I am getting emotionally close with someone, either a crush or just a friend with whom we talk a lot one-on-one, I want them to hurt me physically. It happens with pretty much every new close person and this pattern itself has been present since childhood. It sounds a bit crazy written like that, but I do believe it is actually quite usual. I have not figured out the mechanism. It might be partly to punish myself for getting close with someone. It might be partly to "test" people, to see, how far I can make them go. And to avoid disappointment and trusting them. It is partly just to "get it over with", like a compulsion. Does anyone else have this or does it ring a bell? I have a background of ~15 years of on-and-off self-injury every other year or so. I do not think I have BPD or anything like that, maybe slight PTSD. It's not a sexual thing. And I am highly functional, manage my work and uni etc very well. Ideas about the mechanism?

I’m not sure if this is the right section but I think it’s time for me to start talking about one incident that kept happening to me in school that I keep trying to repress for close to twenty years now. I’m giving a spoiler warning as my story involves sexual assault. I think what is occurring in Hollywood right now is triggering memories I keep trying to forget. Basically the story is when I was in ninth grade,which was from 2000-2001, I was walking down the hall from the locker room to the gym when I felt someone touching me inappropriately from behind and laughing about it. I was horrified and ran off terrified and the female gym teacher saw me run away frightened and went after me. I know who did it because the kid panicked when I ran and screamed “Oh no!” I was too afraid to talk about what he did to me and wouldn’t tell the teacher what had occurred. The gym teachers eventually found out through the others I guess but the kid who did this to me didn’t seem to be punished enough for what he did. I was too traumatized by it that I didn’t even tell my family that I was sexually assaulted. Then the same thing kept happening to me every day I had gym in the locker room for months and whoever kept doing it to me always ran off quickly enough that I never saw who it was but I’m 95% sure it was the same one who did it the first time since he kept bullying me in other ways until graduation. I became so afraid of gym that I would change quickly without ever turning my back and making sure I was the first to get changed and in the gym and first to change and leave the locker room. That is when the school called the crazy lady (the one who abused after she started drinking). She confronted me and then tried to get me to talk but I still refused to annd she then said to me, “That proves you aren’t gay!” as if I was supposed to enjoy being violated the way I was. The last three months of that school year I had to switch to the adaptive gym class for handicapped kids because I was too afraid to go to regular gym.My fear is that he is a sex offender now that is still hurting people and getting away with it because the victims he hurt are also too afraid to talk about it. I’ve felt this way for years but I know that I can’t press charges against him because it was so long ago. Part of me wants to shout out his name as a sexual predator but part of me knows I can’t because of privacy laws and I have no real proof other than the horrible memory of what he did to me. Plus his family has quite a bit of money and I don’t so he’d probably win the case anyway. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m pretty sure if it weren’t for my meds and my dislike of the taste of alcohol, I’d be drinking heavily just to repress the memory of my sexual assault. It was that traumatic for me.

I need friends, but I don't know how to go about making any. I'm 42, diagnosed with bipolar 2, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and PTSD. I feel so depressed right now. I work full time, but am still living pay check to pay check, and I am exhausted, both physically and emotionally. I need a life outside of work, but I fear I have nothing to give in a friendship, let alone more than one friendship.

Hi everyone, this is my first time posting on a forum but I don’t know anyone who really understands how am feeling so am hoping to find someone who does. I am 30 years old and for aslong as I can remember I have felt this underlying sadness but lately I feel like I am unable to hide it. I am not sure where it stems from and I think that’s the issue because I don’t exactly know how to take the steps to fix something when am not sure of the cause. I have terrible negative thoughts about people close to me dying, I feel like there is something missing inside of me to make me happy. I have members of my family who are struggling with depression and I don’t know how to handle it, I know it’s not about me because they are the ones who are depressed, but it’s like I love them so much I can’t deal with the sadness of them being sad so I completely shut down and this can make me seem heartless but I just don’t know how to react so I become numb. I am always the person who offers the best advice and people think I am really strong so for me to come out and say I have been feeling this way it would be such a big shock and I don’t like being the centre of attention so I keep it all in. It’s now affecting my relationship with my partner, as me feeling numb and not being able to communicate my feelings comes across as me being heartless and he isn’t going to stick around for much longer. Somewhere along the line I have learn that showing. your emotions makes you vunerable and I don’t want to be seen in that way. Does anyone else experience anything like this? Everything seems like a big effort I know am not depressed, well I don’t think I am, but something isn’t right. I hope someone can relate to me in some way.

I just don't care. About anything. I cannot help but not care, at all. I believe I am a narcissist. I have come to the point of not wanting to do anything besides sleeping and eating and staying warm this winter. Whenever I try to force myself to do other things, I start feeling incredibly tired and careless. That, and my focus and memory are gone. My mind goes into complete chaos and aggravation. I am constantly depressed. My mood stabilizing pills and anti-depressants don't really do much I think. I am simply a parasite off of my parents. And I don't really care about them either. I have no emotions. Like I said, I'm a narcissist. I still have a fear of death, of dying and being judged by the Christian God. And also a natural fear of death and bleeding in particular. Yet, I feel that I might still be able to commit suicide. However, right now my conditions are not that bad I feel, so there's that that's preventing me. I also know that killing myself would make my parents and relatives sad, so I think I won't do it anytime soon while they are still alive, hopefully. But when there's no one to support me, that's a different kettle of fish. Is there any advice people can give this narcissist, or is there anyone in similar shoes?

Racing thoughts: Does anyone else suffer with this? I get it really bad at night and it keeps me awake and goes through to the day sometimes. It's just one of my symptoms but I haven't been diagnosed with anything in particular yet. I go through what I've done though the day, what I didn't do, conversations I've had wih people, what should I do tomorrow or now. Maybe I should change clothes, 3 or 4 times just to put pj's on again. It's never ending. The way I explain it to my pdoc is its like trying to watch 3 TVs at once. I had it really bad yesterday and rang my support worker and all I could say was "I don't know how I feel, it's just like, I feel like, like, like" I got annoyed with myself in the end and told her "I just like, can't even think" I couldn't even make real sentences. It was scary but I feel better today after a good night sleep. I was told a few months ago I was having a psychotic episode and that's it really. But isn't psychosis just a symptom of something else?

does anyone know what’s wrong with me? for as long as i can remember, i have not been able to feel sympathy/empathy. i pretend to care when others are upset because i feel like i should, but for some reason when others cry or are upset i think the issue is petty and unimportant. to sum it up, i just get annoyed. on top of that, i feel empty. all of the ‘emotions’ i show on the surface are faked. i’m never happy, and i’m never necessarily sad. i’m just emotionless, and the only emotion i can actually feel is anger. i get angry extremely easy, and i find myself snapping at others a lot. my friends always tell me i’m so nice and sweet, but i’m really not. it’s all faked. everything about my personality is fake because i don’t feel anything. i sometimes feel remorse, but only if i get in trouble for something i’ve done. lastly, i tend to only be motivated to do the things that will benefit me. as selfish as it sounds, i can’t help it. i have no idea what’s wrong, but i know it’s not okay. if you have an idea of what i’m talking about, please reply because i could really use some advice.

Fell out with my mother over depression. Hi all, I have suffered with depression and anxiety on and off for a few years now but this past year has been the worst for me. I am on sertraline 50mg and propronalol 140mg. I had a really upsetting episode the other morning and ended up on the phone to the crisis team. I won’t go into all the details but the first person I wanted to speak to was my mam. She ended up telling me she was done with me, I have a perfect life. People have children murdered or raped, and if I had real depression I wouldn’t be able to go out for my partners birhday, and I would of killed myself by now. She then went on to say she felt like she had lost a child with me, I don’t have a relationship with my brothers and sisters, and my boyfriend doesn’t understand me even when he says he does. I am silly for feeling this way because I don’t have a real reason. She was brought up with a paedophile dad and she is skint and can’t afford my siblings Christmas presents so if anyone should be in a dark hole it should be her. She said depressed people don’t air their problems on social media (even though I feel this helps me as I want more people to understand) she said people won’t understand as they aren’t my friends. My mam really upset me she said she’s done with me now and asif I don’t already feel guilty enough for feeling this way she’s now made me feel stupid and pathetic and unworthy. I’ve had to take 3 weeks off work just to sort my Head out. I can’t explain what goes on in my head so how Can I make her understand. She has really upset me and made my illness worse and it’s my 21st birthday on Wednesday and I doubt we will be even made up for that.

I just feel so hopeless: I am in a very bad spot in my life right now. I have battled with depression on and off, but I am currently in a downward spiral of despair. I lost my mom less than two weeks ago. She wasn’t doing well, was in the hospital and she just stopped breathing, everything. They tried to bring her back but nothing could be done. I lost my dad to cancer 2 years ago. I’m 38 y.o., childless. I’m married, but I just don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to hurt my husband, but I just am very very depressed. I know I have to get professional help but it just seems like nothing ever is going to help. I hate my job, don’t have anything to live for. I guess I don’t even know why I’m writing this because I don’t think anything can help. I see nothing ahead for me. I am so lost, I feel like nothing is worth living for.

Advice desperately needed: I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't know if anyone will care. I don't know if I'm just being weak and pathetic here. If you've got a few minutes, please read.. I don't even know what I'm going to write yet but I really need someone to hear it. I broke up with my boyfriend about two weeks ago. I was with him for two years. Those years were filled with an imbalance of emotional distress. I tried, for a large part of it, to ignore my own emotions entirley and give all to help him. After about a year I guess this self suppression became too much and it all started to bubble over, like a stove kettle heated and forgotten. He was a lot older than me. He never ever was physically abusive, unless you can count preventing me from leaving in times of great distress (which I won't, as so many people suffer so greatly). I don't know if he really loved me. But he blamed me for not being able to help him enough. He blamed me for him not having a job. He blamed me for his lying and consequent stealing ( it broke my heart and dreamsof the future when I found out he was lying about ever having a job, actually getting up each morning to pretend to go, and was at the same time stealing hundreds from my house, my room and my mother.) And I STILL took him back, he spoke sweetly and I was trapped again. He told me this was special, no one had anything like this, and oh, if I ever left he would kill himself. " answer the phone now, or I die.' If you ever do drugs again not only will I die but that will be it I will never forgive you you f****** druggy' *two weeks later*: oh I got some stuff for us, we're doing it!!!' He didn't want me to see friends without him present and I was scared to do so as he always caused a huge scene and they wouldn't want to see me anymore. I wasn't allowed male friends really, which is ok I guess I understand. I work alot and help around the house alot due to it being very needed at home, and although he didn't work and I saw him everyday he was always saying how I didn't give him enough time. he used to harm himself and when with an old group of his friends LOVED really really humilating me from time to time, getting them all to hate me and then not telling me they did and getting upset when I didn't want to go there. And when I didit was always drugs drugs drugs and an atmosphere of hostility. I was so scared to leave for a long time it was easier to stay. The stealing kind of ended it for me butI thought the problem was me not listening or caring enough and that I just needed to be better somehow. The constant atguements and doubt werepiling on topof years of emotional pain, trauma and dirstress and maybe it was all my fault or just partly but.. I'm going on here I know this is boring. No one will read this much for me, but I'llkeep typing anyway. So I broke up with him after a horrible argument in which he said " well do you know why I've always lied to you about so much?? It's YOU. You don't care and you don't listen ! I don't have a job because of YOU you won't help me ! My friend X had his girfriend take his CVS out everywhere why can't you be more like her???" I said get out. Its over. I was crying and shaking asking for a break saying I'm sorry I just need to build myself up again please give me some time and he said no. We aren't having a break. I locked him out and said im sorry it's over please go. It was 11 pm or later and he was shouting and crying knowing my family was sleeping, he could see me in great distress through the window and kept tapping it over and over and over and over and over and over an over and over and over and over. I was in such a state when he finally left. Then came the sweet messages. For once I didn't give in. This hurt so bad because I did love him but slowly dawned upon me a sense of freedom and I realised I could be a teenager again. That weekend, about a week after, I went out and did pills. With my friend at her flat. A guy lives in the same building, lets call him J. I was drugged up and happy and untouchable and I kissed and hugged him. My friend had to leave for some reason or another so after a heavy night I stayed in Js room.I mustof looked like such a freak, in his bed with a thick hoody on terrified he would see my abudence of scars and realise I am not fun and happy and nice and sociable and funny or pretty. I had sex with him thatnext morning. It was so stupid. I didn't think I was that type of girl. I regret it alot. But J and I carried on speaking over text and he kept saying he really likes me blah blah trying to get me to come and see him and texting me all the time. Ex found out and I denied it which was probably wrong but he was going to over there and kill the guy. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm going there on Friday for a party. I'm going to be staying with J. Schizoprenia runs in my genes unfortunately, I grew up around a close family member suffering eith it. They all day marijuana switched something in his head. He died three years ago I miss him a lot. I insult him as I have smoked alot of weed. I have done many drugs. I don't smoke as much anymore. Well last night Iwent for a smoke with a mate in another mates car the music was loud and all seemed good I got really high and the twisted stories ( I hesitate to call it paranoia due to the pains of people I have met ) . I thought J was only seeing me so he could film me having sex with him and use it to blackmail me. Thatour mutual friend was in on it and maybeshe and J are sleeping together and she wants revenge for something I have forgotten or never realised.I thought Ex was in on it all too. That I am a huge joke and everyone isin on something. Everyone knows something I dont. I never am smoking weed again, I was so quiet and scared I bet the people I wss with thought I was a freak and i haven't told J maybe some part of me realises it's all stupid and unlikely . I can't eat, I had a some problems with food when I was about 11 of 12. Also self harm, alot of it. I was homless and lived with a family member who wss having a mental breakdown at this age. i witnessed someone self harming badly.. I never lived in a housefor more than 2 years before this, I had no long term friends. We went into care. Didn't stay long. Came out and family member was a lot better and amazing I must say she is amazing. I am not meant to talk about this irs the past i need to get over it right. So a little or i guess long while later when I met Ex I thought he wwas my saviour I was so mentally screwed. I feel like the pains of our relationship have just gone into the same jar and now it's cracking. I can't eat and I'm already skinny enough in myopinion I want to put on weight and I'm just losing it. I work looking after the elderly and I love it but everything feels fake. I just cry all of the time. There is this horrible anxiouspulsating fuzzy weight in my chest and I can't sit still I can't focus on anything I can't do anything I can't sleep until early hours and then I sleep for ages and I'm still tired and I know I suck. This is all pathetic. No one will read this. I have antidepressants prescribed but I'm so scaredd of feeling worse for a month that I haven't taken them and my own personal goal is to tackle this without them but I guess I personally can't do this. I get suicidal thoughts alot but I simply can't leave my family they love and depend on me to some extent I guess I have quite a lot of responsibility in comparison to some of peers as far as I can observe but I'm so scared I'm going to the friwnds and Js on Friday to do pills with all of these other people and when I'm on it I'll shine and be confident and amazing and lovely and I can pretend to be all of these things sometimes like at work but I feel it's all fake im nothing but a parisite at my core. I'm so sad and scared . I'm sorry for wasting your time if anyone did read this it's all pretty pathetic huh? What a waste of time

Neighbors harassing me: Hi guys my neighbors have been harassing me by shining lasers at my window, they use it with a drone. I can hear the drone flying near my window and can see the laser shining at my window though haven't been able to catch it with a camera. I have had to got to hospital to be medicated for a week because it got too much. They keep me up throughout the night and when I get up I can hear them laughing like they are happy harassing me! I have told friends and my mother and they think I'm going mad. Can anyone help me at all???

Shell-shocked: I don't really know where to start, but I'm here because I wanted to find somewhere where others have relatable experiences. I hope it's okay to post in this section; I have done because it doesn't necessarily fit a specific single illness, and is more my experience of the last several months. I have a long history of on-off depression which has gone untreated for years. In spring, I started feeling 'fast'. That's the best way I can describe it. Everything had been going great, I was working well, achieving a lot, and then everything went fast. To start with that was okay; I've never been a great sleeper so I didn't think it was a big deal when I stopped sleeping and I was filling every hour with productive things (work, home improvements, exercise, future plans, you name it). But things got faster and faster and I got more and more impulsive. Sometimes I didn't care, and it felt great but at other times I knew something wasn't right and I felt torn apart because I was out of control. I was referred to my local MH services for mood disorders but there was a long wait to be seen. By July, everything escalated and I experienced my first episode of psychosis. This lasted on and off for a month or so, and no medication they gave me touched me at all - I couldn't sleep, I couldn't stop. I'll not go into details but eventually I crashed down from this, and ever since have been spiraling into the worst depression I have ever experienced. I'm so lost. I'm shellshocked by what has happened to my life. I'm mortified by what I've put my partner (lives away) and a few close friends through. I'm exhausted. I keep doing the things you're supposed to do - I get up in the morning, I take exercise, I've moved back to my parents because I needed other people around me to provide some structure (some expectation to get up and function). It doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm supposed to return to work this month. I don't know how I can do that. I'm going through the motions and it just gets harder and harder to keep awful thoughts at bay. I'm under the early intervention team. They are treating me cautiously for bipolar I think, but won't make a diagnosis because they 'don't want to label' me. I don't expect a miracle from them, but nothing they have done or said helps at all. They just tell me it takes time, but I don't feel I have time. I know nobody here can fix this for me. I don't expect that. But I just wondered if any of you have any ideas how to pick yourself up and move forwards from a major MH episode that's left you feeling like I do now? And I guess I want to know I'm not the only one who feels like this. I think I feel like I've lost control and I need to regain that some how, but nothing I do seems to help. Thanks to anybody who reads this.

Seeking Advice: Hello. This time I'm seeking advice. I think the first time I'm doing so. How can I kill feelings and emotions inside? I wanna kill my sense of logic and thinking as well. In simple words, I want to become a robot. How can I do it?

advice in surviving suicidal thoughts: I've become a regular in posting here, on one hand it's good because I can share things I could not before, on the other hand it's like a sign of desperation and pain. I want advice from people who have experienced it or ones who are professionals - how do you survive these periods of intense feelings of hopelessness and desperation to the point of suicidal urges that are becoming increasingly prominent and terrifying. I'm trying to work with myself to achieve change for the better but I can't do it when I'm that hopeless. It's scary that I'm in this place and sometimes think that I have no choice except ending it all. I don't want to act on these thoughts but I just can't control them, it's like morbid thoughts. Please sharr from your experience.

reported my neighbour for child neglect and drugs: I'm feeling really sick right now. Thursday I reported my neighbour for the neglect of her 1 yr old. He screams 18 out of 24. There's no input with him he doesn't speak and he's stuck at home while the house in darkness as she never opens the blinds. She smokes cannabis from getting up to going to sleep. She then goes and puts the baby in the car and drives under the influence of drugs. Seriously causing me mental distress. I often disassociate as it causes me distress. I just couldn't cope I felt bad I had to tell my dr. So it's been reported to safe guarding department. But what happens next will they find out it's me and will they take her baby away. I wouldn't cope if they took him away. But I can't take it back. Please someone help me. I feel so bad and it's making me ill I'm taking it out on myself. I'm scared I'm going to do something bad to myself with the guilt. (Meaning self harm)

completely hopeless: I don't know how I'll make it. When I feel like I tried everything and it doesn't help - therapy, medication, physical activity, everything. Nothing is helping, and suicidal thoughts are stronger than ever. When suicidal thoughts hit you there is know escape, I don't know how people overcome these places. I have tried to keeo it positive but I have completely collapsed mentally, I can't sleep even with pills, I feel like I am doomed. It is disappointing how I got to this place and that nothing have changed, I feel I have failed. I look at my family, friends, everybody is living their lives and I am stuck. I often think how they will react if I took my own life, how broken they will be, I just can't do this to them but the pain I'm experiencing right now is unbearable. Everything makes me feel bad and hopeless, and someone like me should have never reached this situation. This is the most hopeless and rock-bottom that I have ever felt. I wish I could change all this, change myself for the better, but I can't. The anxiety is too strong, I really don't know how I am going to survive and I feel so lame for writing this here.

My first post here. I'm looking for advice due to my neighbor who seems to have anger issues. For over a year now she has taken to shouting day in and day out at "Someone". I know its not me, I think its her ex-boyfriend who lives next door on the other side. Nothing unusual in that I guess but the problem is it is relentless, it never stops for days. This is having a detrimental effect on my own mental health as I cannot sleep when she is shouting. My Landlord doesn't care and, unlike an antisocial neighbor, she clearly has mental health issues so I don't want to complain to the council and get her evicted if she is already in poor mental health. So I don't know what to do. Currently I've had two days of this - without any break. She's even shouting at "Someone" while doing the housework. Some bad episodes she's often yelling at the top of her voice outside the next door but one. Sometimes bashing the door with a wheelie bin. The police have been round many times but they simply either don't care or don't want to get involved. I'm reluctant to go to her directly as I've been in the situation before where I have then become the object of their anger and had my car vandalised and attempted break ins. It's not as if she's a bad neighbour either as when she is, on the rare occasions placid, she has helped me. I feel I'm just stuck and there's nothing I can do. Currently I'm looking for a new flat before I get to the end of my tether but not a lot is available at my price point. Anyone got some help or advice for this kind of situation?

Anyone have a relative living with dementia?: Dementia touches a lot of people's lives, so is there anyone who wishes to talk about it on here? Just a thought

Hyperventilation: I don't remember if I've asked this question before, yet I'm sorry if I have. I've read on different sites that an anxiety attack, also called panic attack, causes hyperventilation. The thing is I tend to hyperventilate all the time and I also feel short of breath at every moment of the day. I yawn as a reason, I sigh as well and I also take random deep breaths (and after those randomly-timed deep breaths I feel my lungs are finally getting oxygen) potentially at every moment. All these symptoms have no roots in any physical problems. My question is whether this is still possible to be related to anxiety? I wish you all a great time.

My uncommon, irrational fear: I have three fears that I group together into a “fear of things moving that shouldn’t move” which sounds weird, but that’s just what I’ve always called this. Let me explain: Ever since I was really young, I’ve been so scared of things that sway (wind chimes, swing sets, hanging stuff, those giant inflatable flailing tubes that car dealerships always have), and toys that move (my neighbours had this little Christmas tree that opened its mouth and moved its hands that used to make me cry). As I grew up, these fears grew worse; I can’t sleep when it’s windy, as I know things outside are blowing around, I hate the thought of hair blowing in the wind, so I cut mine short, I took the drawstrings out of my hoodies, and I developed a fear of things floating in water (my grandparents live next to the ocean, so when we go boating, I have panic attacks thinking about floating around). My whole life, my friends and parents have made fun of me, and it’s honestly annoying that I fear going new places, as I won’t be able to prepare myself for things that may be hanging. I don’t have much else to say, but I’ll share some stories. In high school, my art teacher had to take all the kids art projects hanging from the ceiling down, as I expressed my discomfort to her. I can’t go in pools, as floaties give me awful anxiety; I go around and throw them out of the water if I can. When servers at restaurants accidentally hit the hanging lights above a table, I can never go back to that restaurant. I don’t go to one friend of my dads house, as she has huge vertical blinds that constantly move When I take a shirt off a hanger, I have to hold the hanger until it stops swinging, and if it hit another hanger, I freak out. I avoid the toy aisles in stores for obvious reasons. I’m tired of all these things running my life, does anyone know what I can do?

Insomnia...help! I have generalized anxiety disorder, I've had it since I was a kid. But a couple years ago, it started affecting my sleep. I talked to my psychiatrist about it and she prescribed me clonazapam for a short period which put me right out, but she eventually took me off it so I wouldn't become addicted. She then prescribed me Valium which in the beginning was helpful, but now it's not doing much for me. Now, I take 15mg of Valium, 10mg of Ambien, 3-4 over the counter sleep-aids (doxylamine succinate) and 3 melatonins...and this barely puts me to sleep, sometimes I still am tossing and turning or staring at the clock. Does anyone experience this? Does anyone have any other tips on how I can combat this without all these pills? I've tried meditation, establishing a routine, drinking chamomile tea, and none of this works. Please someone help!

I have been struggling so so much with my fiance at the moment. We have been together for 3 years and are due to get married next september - something ive always looked forward too but lately i just want to cancel it. When we first got together he was still dating another girl who he continued to see for 6 months into our relationship - he says just as a friend and nothing ever happened between them but he always hid it from me. He always pretended he didnt know and he forgot etcetc. After one year i found out he was watching porn. Every night. Now a lot of people have said that thats normal as he is a young guy and what not. But when i confronted him about it he told me its because im not good enough. Since this he has stopped watching the porn and we have a very good sex life - at times. There are times where he wants it constantly then there are others where we can go a month with no sex and it doesnt bother him. We bought our own house in march of this year and in may i found a pair of pants. Just simple black pants. But they are not mine as i couldnt get them passed my knees. He laughed it off and said they are probably my sisters.. who is bigger than me. We ended up having a couple of weeks apart after this because i was so so sure he had cheated on me. He still has never admitted anything to me and still denies everything. Lately he has been coming home really late. Friday he should of finished work at 1:30 but didnt come home until 6 as he 'worked late again' which has now been 5 days in a row. He is very protective of his phone. Even if he is trying to show me something and i go to hold the phone he pulls it away from me so i cant even hold the phone. He keeps telling me its all in my head and i think a lot of it is but i dont know what to do anymore. I love him more than anything in the world and i couldnt imagine my life without him yet this is all destroying me! I just need a lie detector machine or something to prove that he is or isnt telling me the truth

Family reaction: Hello. I am new here and have joined in the hope that I can discuss things with people who have been through similar things. My question for today relates to how your family has reacted to your anxiety/depression. In short, I suffer on and off from both and have done for many years but was formally diagnosed about 2.5 years ago. I used anti depressants for 2 years and was lucky enough to borrow some money from a supportive family member to pay to see a therapist and am now coping much better. But on first opening up to the other side of my family, I was met with disinterest at best and cruelty at worst. From an general lack of asking how I was to saying things like anxiety doesn't exist, I had made it up, my therapist had put ideas in my head and that I was too confused, lying about the causes. Sadly much of my problem has stemmed from interaction with these family members over the years so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. I don't need to tell you how painful and all consuming mental health issues can be, the worst few years were honestly the hardest thing I've ever gone through. So I have cut off these family members to protect myself from comments that perpetuated my issues, only to be tormented by further hurtful comments and ill feeling towards me from both them and other family. I struggle to understand how anyone could be so cruel to someone who is clearly suffering (and then question the decision for no contact). Perhaps they just don't understand, I will never really know. I am struggling today with the injustice of being treated so badly then being the villain for stepping away from them. Has anyone else experienced this? I'd be so interested to know how you've dealt with any feelings of guilt or anger or just that I am not the only one who has gone through this.

I can't get over something my manager and my mum said. I can't stop over thinking and obsessing about it. How can I get over it? I have been depressed for a few months now and just recently decided to go back to my old singing teacher for singing lessons. I was a bit nervous to see her again because it had been so many years. I thought that was very normal and to be expected. I had not seen her in about 3 years. So we met for the lesson and as we were talking out of nowhere out of the blue she said "it's not good to be so not sure all the time". I was already feeling very depressed and I found this very insulting. So I came home and told my mum (im still living at home and thought she would comfort me). Instead she said something that made me feel so much worse, she kind of agreed with my singing teacher and said "yeah you should be sure", "why not tell your teacher you are sure". The problem is I wasn't even sure what she was talking about. But the whole experience made me feel like its not ok to be "not sure" at times. Like, doesn't everyone go through times of uncertainty and change in their life where they are very unsure? Isn't it ok to be not sure or indecisive? I keep getting attacked by my singing teacher over this and feel very hurt and bullied. A lot of other students feel this way about her as well and myself and one other stopped going to lessons there. But what she said still bothers me. Is it ok to be not sure, aren't we all not sure at times? I'm in between jobs at the moment and employment is a bit uncertain. I feel not sure about what my next job is going to be, or how I'm going to use my degree. I guess im unsure about lots of things in life. My mum said something that implied this wasn't normal. She said something that drove me crazy, it really hurt and I haven't been able to get over it for weeks. She said I should always say I'm sure about things, even if I am not sure. I was going to sing at a gig my singing teacher offered me to sing at, but I didn't really feel ready yet to sing at it. I didn't really feel up for it. And even if I eventually would have been ready to sing at, I was so depressed that I didn't want to. Mum said just say you are sure (when I hadn't even practiced yet or rehearsed the song). It really upset me and made me so angry and I haven't been able to shake it. I've always been the kind of person who is confident enough to be honest. If I am not sure about something yet, I just say I'm not sure yet, I'm sure I'll be ready on the day I'm just not ready yet. I guess I just feel very attacked over this personality trait of mine. It makes me feel depressed that people are criticising something about who I am. I guess my questions are 1) Is it ok to be not sure at times? Aren't we all in life? 2) Isn't it more normal to say straight up. 'I'm not sure yet but will be ready on the day'. Why won't my mum listen to a different point of view? 3) Is it normal to disagree with your parents over fundamental life principles like this? Is it weird I don't agree with her about this? 4) what should I do to get over this / Stop obsessing about it and move on?

Bullying: I recently read about a person bullied by pupils and teachers and the way she solved the problem by moving schools. Why is it that the bullies always get protected? Those who bullied should have been held accountable. It's like the victims of bullying are often made to have counselling this is not right it is the bullies if anyone who should be made to take counselling. That then might solve the problem.

Scary symptoms of anxiety?? I have suffered with anxiety for about 4 years now. The thing I can't bare about anxiety is the scary symptoms that it causes! Not sure if anyone else gets this but I started getting muscle twitches (which have thankfully almost disappeared) and I also get pins and needles sensations in my finger tips, sometimes goes up my hand, in my feet that have on occasion gone up my leg. The only way I get rid of these symptoms is by distraction. I have health anxiety so bad and every little symptom I feel, convinces me that it's another serious illness. It affects my home life, sometimes my work life and just makes me feel like I'm going round the bend! I obsess over every little thing, it makes me so mad at myself....oh to be "normal"

Germphobia, opening up for the first time. Hi, I've had a germphobia for around 5 years now, for so long I kept it to myself and tried to deal with it in myself, I kept to myself for so long as to I was and still am embarrassed by it. I also thought I could get rid of it on my own. I have looked over what I wrote and it's quite lengthly, if you are able to give your time to give it a read and any response I would appreciate it a lot! It has gotten to the stage now I've had it for so long and it has effected my life bad, I've decided enough is enough I need to speak out in some way and try and seek help. It is something I've some what had a denial to by thinking I could get it to go away and telling myself "I don't want there to be something wrong with me" I had dealt with it on my own for a long while until others around me had noticed, the only person I can open up to and talk about it to is my girlfriend who has been so helpful and done so much for me, although I can open up and talk to her about it there is still some stuff I feel embarrassed of and can't tell her. Apologies for the long essay this is just the first I'm getting it properly of my chest and have so much to say. When I was younger I was never afraid of germs, it is something that started effecting me while I was in hospital for a few days, my brother pointed out about germs such as MRSA and me touching things and eating etc as like I said I had no issue with germs. From here it sort of got into my head and from what I can remember I suddenly had a fear of germs from when I wasn't in hospital, I wouldn't wear my clothes I had wore in hospital etc. Now hospital germs do not bother me at all and I've came now to be extremely afraid of toilet germs, I was on holiday and hadn't noticed our toilet was leaking from the bottom, a pair of my shorts ended up being soaked from the leaking toilet, I just got changed and brought the soaked shorts home with me and washed them when home and continued to wear them and clothes from my case without an issue. One day I was working and got some cat fieces on a cloth I was using to clean, I had a sore head after this and someone told me about toxoplasmosis and it's effects, this is when I started worrying about germs again. After a while I had a fear of germs from the toilet and would not wear any of my clothes from the holiday I had been on although I had wore them a lot before hearing about toxoplasmosis without a worry, I also wouldn't wear clothes that had been in drawers etc with those clothes as I felt they were contaminated. One day I went to the toilet and got splashed by toilet water, I started worrying about this, when i got homemade I washed my clothes then I started thinking the washing machine was contaminated and couldn't wash clothes in that washing machine but I could use towels my mum had washed in the washing machine to dry myself but could it wear the clothes. With my mum and dad wearing clothes they had washed in there as well as touching my clothes I felt were contaminated I began to feel like they were covered in germs, these germs from the toilet I fear; in my head spread, for example all over a person, all over a surface. If I get splashed my toilet water I would have to get showered for a very long time and throw out the shower gel I had used and clothes I was wearing etc. I regularly showered for very long periods and washed my hands for long periods when I felt dirty. I then began to feel like I couldn't eat stuff cooked in my parents house. I decided to move out to get away from the germs because it was really effecting my life and had essentially ruined it. I love my family but because of my phobia I stayed away from them for 2 years and didn't see them as I felt they were covered in germs. For around 6 months I was living with it well, I had a new job and wasn't able to go about my daily life again, then suddenly I was back to the bad fear, this then caused me to leave my job and eventually had me living in an actually germy environment, I would go days without getting washed as I felt I had no clean clothes I could wear, I wouldn't wash doe dirty surfaces, the house I was renting became a real dirty place that someone without s germphobia couldn't live in. I've since moved out and am back in my parents and seeing my family and don't feel like they are covered in germs anymore, my girlfriend and I got a new house closer to my parents and where I grew up but was alightly afraid of moving in because the toilet was right beside the bath/shower and was worried that by flushing the toilet that small amounts toilet water would sometimes splash into the bath. My girlfriends family have been in our old house (the one that got extremely dirty to the extent it was unliveable) as it belongs to a relative of theirs, my girlfriend cleaned it when we moved out as she knew I was unable and freaked out at the thought of it, although she cleaned the house I can't feel the house is clean as it was extremely dirty at the end when we moved out, her mum is a cleaner and gave it a proper clean when we moved out as would be when majority of tenancys end. Since then her mum got us a tv from her friend for our new house, I thought I was ok with it and got it brought to our house, now it's on our new house I feel like it isn't covered in germs and now my house is covered in germs, I've had the house for 3 months and haven't moved in because of this and have been trying to get over it myself but I'm realising I can't and I need help. Her family began to around a year ago I had a germphobia and now I'm home again my family have noticed and my mum has tried to get me to speak to my doctor but I didn't want to as I felt embarrassed and kind of didn't want anth to admit there was "something wrong with me". I know the phobia is silly and it's all on my head, but as much as I know that it's really silly I can't get over it. Sorry for such a long story just thought I would get it all out as this is the first I've opened up about it. If anyone could helped I would appreciate it so much as my life has basically been ruined from it. Also if anyone needs any help or to talk also I'm happy to help others in anyway.

Hair loss: I've been on antipsychotic meds for mental health for almost a decade and I have suffered from hair loss for a long time. I think the meds are making my hair fall out, I just wanted to know if there is anyone else experiencing this.

Feel like giving up: Hi and sorry in advance for my first post but I just don't know what to do. In the last year I have lost my father, gran, uncle, godparents, best friend and several other friends from cancer/accidents. Despite putting on a brave face and returning to work, my boss who knows about everything has been bullying me. I've been told to take action but I'm not strong enough despite plenty of evidence and witnesses. I'm on citalopram and speak to a specialist counsellor every fortnight but every time I'm alone my anxiety and depression take over. I have resigned due to the bullying. I just couldn't cope with it this year. No job to go to. A disabled brother to care for. Money worries. I just feel like giving up. There really is no joy in waking up. Feel like a total failure and have no idea how I can get through this

Anxiety? Not sure what to do! Helloo everyone 😊 just joined and this is my first post. I’m currently at university and spend a lot of my time on placement within a hospital. I’ve been there for about a year and 3 months. During this time I’ve gone from absolutely loving what I do to panicking when it comes to putting a mask on and getting scrubbed! I have had some issues... mainly the person in charge of me tends to go out of their way to make things difficult for me. I tend to keep myself to myself regarding my personal life and this is apparently causing problems because this particular person thinks I should be more open (and gossip). The other students in my group don’t really bother with me much because of this particular person saying stuff about me. I had my end of year test which I had to prepare for all by myself as they offered me no help unlike the other students. Spoken to uni about it and basically got told to man up. I go all sweaty and dizzy and start to feel sickly. It’s awful. Recently this week I’ve been set ‘targets’ by this person... this includes me sitting with our group of students whilst in lecturers rather than sitting with my friends. I also have to meet with them for a teambuilding lunch on my day off each week. I’m going to speak to Uni tomorrow to see if there is anything I can do. I’ve tried asking for a change of placement and they refused saying it would be character building for me. I honestly feel so fed up. I get panicky just being on a bus or in a shop! I feel like I’m a shadow of my former self. I avoid situations where I know I will panic 😩 I don’t want to go to the doctor if I can help it as I’m hoping to go in the forces once I qualify. Any help would be greatly appreciated

With psychotic depression can a mood be so low it is like a psychosis? is suicide a major factor in psychosis? what I mean is when a person is suicidal relating to depression is that considered a psychotic episode??

Life is sometimes too much to bear....money worries, stress and depression make it even harder. But how do you cope when everything you do in life just seems so pointless? Never really feeling suicidal, but not really wanting to be here either? How to deal with feeling like you are living a lie, playing a game, acting a play, keeping up the charade that everything is fine and normal and finding very little joy in anything? Feeling disconnected and alone with your thoughts and everything seems surreal. A bystander watching life pass by, but not feeling it? Afraid to share these thoughts and feelings with family and loved ones for fear of showing weakness or even unraveling completely just by admitting it out loud? Welcome to my life.

To start this, I'll be blunt and say I'm not even sure that I'm posting in the right place. Regardless, I hope you all can help me. To some of you this may be offensive. How do I know? If I’m a bad person, that is. Am I? My mind says no, but my heart says yes. Emotionally, I’m a harsh human being of almost zealous callousness. I can’t understand why. Why do I feel like I NEED to be callous? It’s even more stupid because I am so desperate for love. I feel alone. Is it a cycle that feeds itself? Do I sink further and further? I can’t even tell anymore. Let me give some examples, to state exactly what kind of person I am… -Whenever I hear of a mass shooting or bombing (or otherwise terrorist action, killing spree, etc.) I think about how it could be done better. -My last real girlfriend (non-distant relationship) broke up with me because I was “too psychologically unstable”. Her reason for saying this was that I threatened a guy who was hitting on her. (I am a 280 pound behemoth of a person- I’ve been told I look like an NFL lineman.) I told him I’d put him in the hospital. -I get angry at the DUMBEST things. People going one mile below the speed limit, old people in Walmart, you get the point. Dumb stuff. I legit get angry. -This is an oddball one. I once saw a stinkbug drowning in a cup of water, and moved by emotion, freed it from its captivity so it could live. Yet when I see someone break a bone or twist an ankle, I won’t move to help them. In many ways I abhor them for wasting my time. -I rarely smile. When I do it’s a dumb “I can’t control my smile” kind of smile. I hate it. I’ve gained some not good weight (college is a bitch) and hate how my smile looks now. Regardless, my common face is noted to be angry. -I can’t let go of grudges. A guy I knew in 4th grade ran into me the other day. I was a pretty emotional kid in elementary school and middle school, and it was easy to make me cry. This guy- he stole my pencil in 4th grade. I didn’t care about it, it wasn’t special. I legit cried when he stole it though. He tried to act friendly with me. I told him I hated him and he’d be doing society a favor by dying. -I want to join the armed forces just for comradery. Better than being alone. I figure if I die, I might do the world a favor anyway. -I measure people as a resource, ranging from valuable metals to literally more expendable than dirt. I consider myself dirt, the status quo of humanity. Perfectly expendable and easily replaceable. -I’m an atheist by default, not by choice. I feel like I’m “too smart” to believe in God. I know the bible wasn’t officially made canon until roughly 325 or something like that, and the Jewish version of god can’t exist if he allowed his people to nearly be exterminated in the Holocaust, right? I know this is an insult to religious individuals, and I’m sorry. I wish I could choose to ignore reality and place my faith into something I can’t see, but I literally can’t do it. This is it’s own set of issues, leading me to have NO spiritual balance. -I’m stubborn BEYOND comparison. I have lost friends over the STUPIDEST things. Just because I can’t NOT argue with them if we differ in opinion. I constantly feel like I will lose my best friends because their opinions differ from mine. -I hate drugs. What a fucking waste. Why the HELL do people take drugs? Ever? Also I do mean ILLEGAL ones. Weed… sorta counts. To me it does. I have nearly lost a friend to weed, and he wasted a lot of potential he has. -I make small lies consistently until I believe them. This is weird, I know. Sometimes my past is too blurred with lies and reality for me to remember what ACTUALLY happened. Everything I am saying here is the truth, but know that I lie all the time in person. Usually it’s just to be funny or talk about my ridiculous friends, the few I have. -I am a virgin. I’m 20. I feel isolated for that alone. For someone who doesn’t believe in eternal damnation or heaven (not really, at least…) I have a surprisingly strict moral code. I just can’t have sex with people if I don’t feel like it will be eternal. This is also a factor in my only two actual relationships ending. -I’m awkward. I stutter all the time and get anxious easily. Working retail has helped a bit, but it still happens quite often. I hope this has done some work to help you understand what kind of person I am. Yet all I feel like is a coward, a liar, a monster, and a criminal. I haven’t even committed any crimes, I just feel like I will one day. I feel ugly and unloved, more than that unlovable. I want help, and going to counseling hasn’t helped me. Is it a lack of maturity? Maybe self-hatred created from nothing? I should mention now that I have always been loved by my parents, but I feel like a disappointment. My brother is great at everything, and I’m useless. They always tell me that’s all in my head, and it’s true. Yet I can’t help but feel I am just a great big disappointment. Additionally, I was VERY depressed for about 6 or 7 years, starting with the death of my cat (my first memories are of her, and I love animals). A year or so later a friend shot himself (ruled an accident, but I know better. His parents believe that God had greater things in mind for him. I hope they die, I hate them more than anything in this world.) and ultimately I felt no difference. He was my friend, not even a good one. A friend nonetheless. At 14, it seemed so unreal to most. My commentary was more like “this kind of thing happens.” Please. Help me. I fear that at this rate, I will become suicidal (again), homicidal, and worst of all… that I will never be able to get a lasting relationship. I feel so unloved. I don’t feel like I deserve it. So please, help me. I need advice, even opinions. Anything will do.

im currently dealing with a lot of mental illnesses and I dont know how much more of it I can bare. Im currently diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Major Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Psychosis, Paranoia, Aspergers and lastly Sensory Interegation Disorder. I know its alot and you probably dont believe me but its true and I want someone to actually listen to me and not push me away because thats what people do to me... I dont have friends because of my Aspergers, Schizophrenia and paranoia; my "friends" will literally walk away faster than me put their headphones in and walk away so they cant hear me. Or tell all 5 of us in the group to go to a teachers classroom and hang out but only say "lets all 4 of us go to this teacher " when he knows there are 5 in the group.. I cant even meet new people because I cant look at people in their eyes when I talk or talk on the phone with them cause im completly scared out of my mind that they are making fun of me and are trying to hurt me but they are not and I know that but the voices inside tell me they are. Ive been on so much medicine and been to so many therapist appointments and psychiatrist appoints, but still cant help believe these delusions. To this day everyday Im depressed and have so many anxiety attacks and so much depersonalization i get scared so I cant help but self harm parts of my body i dislike and self harm in visible places so maybe people will help instead of pushing me away. I feel numb inside to a point I wanna kill myself and have attempted twice and still dont have a tear to shed no matter how hard I try to cry. I cant even eat food anymore because I constantly have an image and thoughts in my head of someone throwing up or nasty stuff in general

I was hoping that those of you that have been dx'ed with psychotic depression at one point or another) could share a few answers with me (if possible). Here they are: At what age were you dx'ed with psychotic depression? Did the psychosis start at the exact time as the depressive state? (If not which started 1st)? Once the depressive state was resolved did the psychotic features remain? Was there ever a time that you felt well enough that your doctor allowed you to wean off of your meds? If so, how long did the weaning process take? Did you ever relaspe?

I just want to die peacefully: I know I'll have to tiptoe around due to forum guidelines. I just want to go. My future looks bleak. I live in poverty, I have food but I cant afford my favorite drink. Soda. I'll continue to live in poverty. My benefits case has been open over 2 years now. My attorney says it may be another 2 years, possibly longer. I did some research the other day about substances that could be harmful. I checked into what I thought to be the most dangerous substance I can get my hands on. I found a pro suicide website that had an alphabetized list of dangerous substances as well as the quantity necessary to cause harm. I found out that there's another substance that I have that's even more harmful and in smaller quantities. Oddly enough there's a fairly common MH substance that requires over a thousand to be harmful. How in the hell could someone get a hold of that much of a substance? Then I looked into another section that listed levels of pain caused be certain actions and the length of time those actions would take to achieve a certain result. I still don't know if it was morbid curiousity or intention that drew me in. Today I'm thinking that I'm glad that I have the information. I'm thinking of harming myself. I just want the pain to go away. Maybe I'll get lucky and after you die there's just nothing. Nothing forever and ever and ever. This thought comforts me. I don't like the idea of a frozen hell or a burning hell. I have this mental image of a hell where everything is as twisted as my mind. Demons feasting upon the weak. Murders, torment, and torture. I have an image of hell being much like the earth, but in a post apocalyptic world. A ruined earth. In this place its everyone for themselves because every resident is just as sick and demented as you are. I think if there is a hell that's where I would want to be. Have you ever seen the movie Constantine? When he goes to hell that's a lot like my vision of hell. There would be a lot of bold colors there. Lots of black, crimson, and rust tones. Lots of darkness and eyes peering at you from the sewers and from under rocks. The shadow people I'm sure would be there. No longer in hiding. I could finally be able to challenge them face to face. Even a burning hell would be better than the insanity I suffer in my brain. I just want it to stop. Forever.

I have been self harming since Wednesday night. I self harmed. I wanted to do feel it again Thursday morning so I self harmed again and yesterday and today. I think I am now addicted. How am I gona stop??! Obiously I am struggling so much that is why I am self harming

Feel empty: Yesterday I tried to take my own life and ended up in hospital for most of the day, wasnt sectioned though. I feel so numb now and don't know what to do

first post so a bit new to all this. I'm in a residual rehab at this moment for both drugs and help with Bi Polar II. iv been steady for a while now thanks to taking my meds prober. but I am getting the odd days off manic depression and find it very hard to express the way I am feeling or even identify what's going on. I write a lot and this helps, using images to try and describe what is going on. I feel if I was to just rant it would come out as a "I hate the world, they way we are organised and the human race" rant but want to understand the core off this hate. the closest I think I can get to it is I feel like all my insides have been sucked out and replaced with a thick fog. or like iv been plugged in to something that's taking control of my soul.... self harming brings me back into this world for a while and gives me a rush, to that I find very addicting. I had gone about 2 months without self harming but relapsed early last week . and have gone from a Huge dip to Manic . what is also worrying me is I am starting to have thoughts off self harm even in manic phases. I will share more of my story in other posts . don't really know what I'm asking tbh but even the act of writing this down has helped.

Parenting a teen help advice: My daughter (15) has been self harming and we only found out about 3 weeks ago so we are new to this journey. My daughter is now seeing a psychologist, which she hates doing. She still tells us that what she is doing is fine because it works and there is nothing wrong with it. As her parents, we are now scared to discipline her for anything for fear that it might make the situation worse. Or that she will withdraw from us even more. Does anyone have experience with this or any advice on discipline? She has started shifting the friends that she hangs out with at school. She seems drawn to the more rebellious group of children. We hate to see her get more involved in unhealthy behaviours but we feel powerless to prevent it.

Recently I've become even more suicidal than I had previously been and am seriously considering taking my own life. My friends know of this, the NHS knows of this and they're doing nothing to help. Anyway, if it were to result in a failed suicide attempt what would happen if the police were involved? Would you be sectioned immediately or taken in for questioning?

Parent Seeking Advice: I recently found out that my daughter has been self-harming. We had a long and really open discussion about it in a non-confrontational way and she even proffered her tools which I hadn't intended to take off her. She said she hadn't harmed for quite a long time before this incident which was brought about by her first excursion into the town near her school to meet with friends and resulted in her being beaten up by a girl in the year above her at school who had been drinking alcohol all afternoon. I took my daughter to the Doctor to try and get a referral to CAMHS and arranged with work to be able to work one day a week from home so i could be around more, and had her signed off school for the last week. I have asked her if she wants to go back to school and she has said no - so I plan to let her be home-schooled from September. My concern is that having removed her from the people I believed had been causing her distress/abuse/bullying etc I now find it hard to understand why the desire to self harm is still happening as this was her first incident in a while (unless she wasn't truthful about this being the first instance). I've suggested she join a discussion forum so that if she feels the need to self-harm she could seek the support of others to help her but she is not very receptive to this idea or to the list of suggested alternatives that I found on the internet as ideas from people who had self harmed in the past and what they found useful. Despite me being open and non judgmental with her she still finds it difficult to talk to me when she has self harmed but will discuss it with her sisters (which is something). Just would really like to know what I should be doing to help her and feeling somewhat helpless instead.

I need help resisting the urge to self harm: About a month ago someone leaked nude pictures of me without my consent. The pictures included my name, face, and personal info. I was threatened that the photos would be sent to friends and family by the poster. I have been harassed and tormented online. I cry myself to sleep every night and I self harm almost everyday. I have constant thoughts of suicide. I have anxiety and paranoia about the photos being reposted or sent to my parents. I google my name every thirty minutes. The sound of notifications startle me, I'm afraid that it is someone telling me they found my pictures. The anxiety has also affected everyday things. I will check if I brought my keys with me every hour that I am not home and I check that I placed my books inside my backpack 10-20 times before I leave my apartment. I need to stop because its making me ill. I don't know what I can do to stop the urges. I want to stop but I don't know how.

Is physical self-punishment bad? I've heard of people giving themselves rewards for being able to do things they have trouble doing, and I've also heard of people (adults) punishing themselves when they do something they believe is wrong, either by depriving themselves of a treat (dessert, TV, etc.), or, in rare cases, by physically hurting (but not necessarily harming) themselves. Is punishing yourself, particularly by causing yourself (harmless) pain, wrong or unhealthy? I know this may be subjective, but I just wanted to hear other people's thoughts on it.

Unable to stop doing things which can get you in trouble. Does anyone exhibit stalker behavior when a significant loved one, family member, or friend ceases to talk to you? The person exhibiting the behavior knows it is wrong and dangerous but they do it anyways. Partly because of the excitement it generates coupled with moments of seeing the individual are to great to pass up.

cant stop buying things: I have a problem where I buy things all the time, I posted this on the depression forum but my post did'nt appear. I buy mostly from charity shops and have far too many clothes and shoes, this is a big problem for me as we have had to take out a loan. I want to save and go on holiday next year but am worried I will whittle money away. Does anyone else relate to this?

Going out alone: I suffer from Social Anxiety and going out on my own is really difficult. I can go to certain familiar places on my own, at the time of day when I know it's not going to be busy, but if I need to go somewhere unfamiliar or even somewhere familiar but during a busy time I need someone with me. How can I overcome this fear? Has anyone here experienced the same problem and how did you overcome it?

Clothes question: I know people can have issues with things like elastic,labels, and tags on clothes. What about the material though ie cotton, polyester, silk etc ? The most I ever noticed it was a shirt I had to wear for football from time to time when at prep school. I have no idea what the material was other than it wasn't polyester and didn't feel like normal cotton. I used to really dislike that sports shirt. The material was itchy and horrible against my skin . I never used to hear the other boys complaining though , and guess they had no problem with it.

Anyone been misdiagnosed with Asperger Syndrome when they have borderline personality disorder or they been misdiagnosed with BPD when in fact they have got Aspergers/autism? Anyone actually got both conditions? I know both conditions share similar traits, such as emotional reactivity, interpersonal difficulties, impulsive issues, and problems with odd thinking.

Everyone patronises me! I have aspergers and ADHD, so it's sometimes hard for me to perform tasks other people might find easy, or even talk to other people. I also have dyscalculia, so math is incredibly hard for me to work out, which probably makes me seem dumb whenever I have to handle money or something. So yeah, I'm pretty slow in a lot of ways, but I like to think I'm still good at other things, and have a basic understanding of the world to the point that I don't need to be hand-held! Of course, all of my peers disagree, and insist on talking down to me whenever they see me, they explain things to me with that patronising, condescending voice usually reserved for an animal or a toddler, they laugh at me whenever I do something silly or clumsy, and then go 'aaw sorry, let me help you', and whenever someone says anything even remotely challenging or subtle to me, they'll be like 'hey lay off him, he doesn't understand!' Even when I achieve things, they're sometimes patronising about it. I remember once when I started dating someone, people acted with surprise, as if it was impossible that a guy with a mind like mine could ever attract someone, and then they'd either treat me with pity (thinking it wouldn't last), or refuse to believe I was really dating them. I've written a novel, and four feature-length screenplays, all of which have gotten good responses from professionals I've sent them to, but in the eyes of my peers, they're just my little hobby that won't go anywhere, and they're probably terrible anyway. I've always felt like an outsider, and this attitude really hasn't helped, I'd probably be much closer with people and have less trouble connecting with them if they'd just treat me like a damn adult.

I think I might have Autism, but I'm not sure. Can someone help me, please? I am watching a Susan Boyle interview and they're talking about how she found out that she has Asperger's Syndrome. And they talk about how she felt like she didn't fit in back in school and had emotional outbursts, and I just relate to a lot of the side effects. Obviously this doesn't mean that I have this, but I've just been wondering. I went through tests and they first said I had Schizophrenia. Then Schizoaffective Disorder. And a few times, they even said I was Bipolar. I don't know what's true and what's not. Susan Boyle also mentioned that growing up, people thought she had a learning disability. When it comes to math, I have a learning disability there. I don't know if this is a connection to Autism, so I'm not sure if I can list it as a symptom.

Empathy - do I have it? A friend of mine says I have no empathy for other people. But I'm sure that I do. I just don't have it for babies and children (which most people seem to go absolutely ga-ga for - I hate them) When I had a girlfriend I loved her with all my heart and I wanted her to be happy (still do). I don't feel much for my mother, and I hardly grieved when my dad died. But I cry at films, (when they are happy). I get really involved in books - I feel what the hero feels. I'm sure I have empahty - it manifests in different ways. But I can't explain what those ways are

It sounds like your empathy is mostly around positive things, and not so strong around family. That doesn’t mean it’s not there. I’d suggest to your friend that maybe he needs to be more compassionate himself rather than making judgments. One exercise I’ve found really helpful around empathy and compassion is considering how other people suffer. Everyone suffers and has difficulties in their life. When people ask us, “how are you”, we generally just tell some niceties, we don’t really go into how we actually feel, how in fact we too suffer. But if you can imagine someone else’s suffering, it helps you to feel compassion for them, and that is empathy.

Eye contact-such a tricky one: I don't like to make eye contact but make myself do so because it's expected when you are interacting with people. I am never sure how long is too long though, and whether I'm over compensating or not. After all there's not making eye contact vs outright staring at someone. Thoughts welcomed.

Really Pissed Off: I have had massive problems my whole life, as long as I can remember, have never fitted-in, never really understood why. But I'm starting to When I was nipper in primary school, I took some real shit. I was once massively embarrassed by a teacher, who put me before the class and smacked my arse. I hate her guts - and she's still a teacher, or was until recently. Why did she smack my arse, and humiliate me in class? I had a problem - a very noticeable one. I used to nod my head, fling my arms out, spit out, make grunting sounds, and whisper or shout out 'piss off fucking hell' very quickly, and over and over. I couldn't help this. It just came, and if I didn't, it felt like I would burst. My family went back to our GP again and again and a-fucking-gain. I was in my first year of primary school when my arse was smacked, so I was pretty young. I did get to finally see a child psychiatrist in my first year of secondary - I was 11. That's a long time to go through highly toxic, stigmatizing, destructive shite, that makes you a massive laughing stock, and target for bullies, both child and adult. What did the psychiatrist conclude, after just about six sessions in the child guidance clinic? That I was 'well-adjusted', and there was nothing to worry about. Wow. And guess what? The same psychiatrist I read about in the local paper some years later, was sent to prison for being a dirty pedophile, who abused kids in his inpatient facility. Another wow. I wasn't an inpatient. I was an outpatient. But does a man who has a sexual interest in young children, have their best interests at heart? Does he fuck. He was a proper sadistic twat, who I maintain got off on fucking kids up, by leaving them untreated and in the shit. I believe I was deliberately case-closed with what at the time, was clearly Tourettes. My life is in ruins in some, if not all, respects. I have never had a career or anything productive to do, I do not connect with people all that well, I have no reliable circle of friends, I have no satisfactory intimate relationship. I had my last girlfriend at 16, and it lasted a week. I have had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and have recently been diagnosed with ASD. There are very suspect and highly questionable logs - both NHS and policing - attached to my address. I was first arrested in my 40's, and had no criminal or forensic history prior to that. I have NEVER been taken to court, despite trying in my own way, to secure some judicial and legal review of my situation. I wonder fucking why? Answers on a post card. Innit. LOL. You're supposed to receive a conviction notice or similar aren't you, when professionals in your care, are had up for serious offences. I have been ambushed too. I think the cowardly fucks in the NHS and the Police want to paint a bad a picture of me as they can, to cover their own dirty, sorry backsides.

How to control tics at some degree (from my personal experience). I am 18 now. I was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome approximately 2,5 years ago. I have noticed that changing place where you are located now (for example, going outdoor if tics started at home) can help a lot. I don`t have already that tics outdoor. They disappear. Certain tics are associated with certain enviroments, situations, people etc.

Tourettes & Tardive dyskinesia: I've read another thread about tardive dyskinesia and I'm concerned about this and wondered if anyone could give me any information on this condition and whether or not it may relate to what I have been through over the last 3-5 years. It may be completely unconnected.... My sons and my sister both had tics / ADD up until puberty. It was never determined whether Tourettes was the main or secondary diagnosis. I was not affected, but given the hereditary aspect, I am concerned that I may be at risk with dopamine antagonists and that this may have been the cause. I suffered extreme withdrawl problems (jaw clenching, parkinson type movements, extreme sweating and temperature control problems and autonomic nervous system failures) when I came off Escitalopram. I also suffered coronary muscle spasms during this period which the doctors couldn't explain. I was left with a slow and irregular heart beat.When I first took the drug I couldn't shut my eyes (literally) for 3 days and I felt "wired".... they reduced it to 5mg for two weeks and then kept me on it on a 10mg dose. All this was for very mild anxiety and depression. The "withdrawl" symptoms lasted for about 3 and a half years and 1 year in they gave me a pacemaker as it was clear that my heart muscle wasn't recovering. The symptoms waxed and waned during that period and 5 years later the other symptoms have petered out and pretty much gone, although I am left with a pacemaker. I was on the drug (on and off) for 7 years at a low dose and had no symptoms until I stopped taking it. I read in this information that Tourettes is a risk factor and that some SSRIs have been implicated as causing tardive dyskinesia. Does anyone know anything about this? Could I carry the gene for Tourettes if my sons have inherited it and my sister had it too? I didn't suffer myself. My doctor has referred me to a psych who seems intent on proving "health anxiety" or "personality disorder." Borderline PD is apparently characterised by intense emotions which are capable of inducing autonomic dysfunction, and the doctor's take seems to be that I had a heart problem anyway (!!!) (No family history, no risk factors, age 45 and no problems prior to taking the drug) and that BPD and intense health anxiety could cause me to have "imagined" that the autonomic problems were the fault of the drug. The psych seems to think I should go back on the drug....some kind of "exposure therapy".....He can forget it!! I also read a little about trauma causing this condition to develop/worsen. I was traumatised by being told I had suffered a heart attack (initially), and then by being told I would need heart surgery (pacemaker) and then being told that my autonomic nervous system wasn't working properly. It caused me to develop a deep depression and significant anxiety. Frankly I'm disgusted and insulted that they can dismiss this as "imagined" symptoms. They were very real and the pacemaker in my chest kind of proves that I didn't imagine that part! My mental health has fallen apart since and I'm struggling to be taken seriously as a result, because I'm angry and scared, and have become very negative. I'm really struggling with this. Can anyone shed any light? Does anyone know anything about Escitalopram and dopamine? I'd be really grateful for any information.
