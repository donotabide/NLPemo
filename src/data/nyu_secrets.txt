"Last Thanksgiving my cousin's new wife, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white girl called me and the rest of my Mexican family racist cuz we said "white privilege exists." It takes a lot of white privilege to be white and call minorities racist. #cringegiving."

"I had a lovely Thanksgiving with my family until my mom brought up how Die Hard was her favorite Christmas movie. We spent literally an hour and a half in an argument over whether or not it is a holiday movie (it totally is), which ended in my family and I storming out of my cousin's house. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! #CringeGiving."

"To the well-dressed boy who approached me at the edge of Washington Square Park on November 6th: I've never had anyone run after me just to politely introduce themselves, tell me they noticed me walking through the park, and that I looked pretty — that might just be one of the sweetest encounters with a stranger I've ever had.
I was actually having an overwhelmingly stressful day, and your thoughtful gesture really cheered me up! I greatly admire your courage (bolder than anything I could ever manage) and appreciate how courteous you were throughout our short conversation. Usually the type of guy to approach me is a serious creep, an asian fetishist, or someone who makes me feel unsafe walking around at night, so it was incredibly refreshing to meet someone so genuine and endearing.
As I mentioned (and I hope you didn't think I was lying to try to get out of anything), I do have a boyfriend of 4 years, and didn't feel it was appropriate to give you my number or stay in contact in any way. But I just felt horrible for leaving so suddenly (I was flustered and thought it was a prank/dare!) and wanted to get this message to you somehow. You seemed like a stellar guy and, objectively, you are also super good looking! Your next girlfriend found a keeper! Wishing you the best."

"Guess our professor forgot about daylight savings, cuz he took a look at his watch at 1 and said "all right, looks like we're out of time!" (class ends at 2) The entire class just looked at each other with that "do we tell him" look, then we all got up and left and honestly I've never felt this level of community at NYU ever before."

"Pretty sure OP is talking about the Anime class I'm in. I was so surprised when no one said anything. I guess the last 30 minutes of magical-schoolgirl-in-Feudal-China shojo were enough to crush everyone's spirit lmao."

"Went to the doctor today and apparently I have all of the symptoms (obvious and messed known) of being pregnant. Waiting for the bloodwork. Checked recently about my thyroid so that's not the issue. I feel like I should be freaking out because it's literally impossible for me to be pregnant but honestly I'm more excited to see how much it would freak a bunch of racists out to find out that Jesus came from an Asian."

"Last weekend, I hosted a halloween party, when friends went into my room to get something, found my American Whopper dildo instead, brought it outside into the living room and started tossing it around. By the end of the night, people were using it as microphones, trying to get the suction end to stick on the ceiling, and covering it in glitter makeup. It was all fine, until the next day, I noticed it was gone. My roommates and I turned our entire apartment upside down, and we still couldn't find it. it's been a week now, and we still have no idea where it is.
Tl;dr Somebody stole my dildo, and I have no idea what to do with my life now."

"As a man, I have been sexually assaulted by a woman in the past. I have wanted to join the #MeToo movement for some time now, but I’m afraid I’ll be ridiculed or berated. Every time I have told a friend about my experience I have always been told “It’s not a big deal, she was probably just messing around” or “well if she was hot, then why is it a problem?” Sexual assault is sexual assault, and I should be able to come clean about my experiences without being told they’re not real."
[.C]
"Im a flaming feminist and Im here for you. This system hurts men and doesn't allow them much emotional release. A feminist who wants to see a better world realizes the pain of everyone. I'm sorry if others have made you feel discounted. There are so many opinions out there these days it's hard for good ones to be heard. I hope others don't discourage you from telling your story. I wish you peace"

"Growing up, my parents at best, were emotionally neglectful and at worst, emotionally abusive. Since then, I've been forced to fend for myself in terms of providing myself emotional and mental support. I'm thankful they're paying for my college education but I sometimes wish they weren't. Aside from supporting me financially, which I greatly appreciate and am so thankful for, they constantly berate me, are condescending, and blame me for things that aren't my fault. I wish I could cut them off, but I know that I can't. Is it bad I'm sticking around just for the free tuition?"
[.C]
"My advice, ignore all the commenters here who clearly don't have sympathy for victims of abuse and speak to a therapist while doing some serious math on what your expenses and income potential is. Parental abuse and neglect is real and so is the financial decision to give up thousands and thousands of dollars. If they are really abusive, they know that paying for your college puts you in their debt, and paying for it yourself will put you in debt to the bank/government. There isn't one answer for this but I hope you figure out what's best for you."

"I hate my body. It faces a wage gap, underrepresentation in corporate boardrooms and poliitics, and stigma in society. Little kids watch Disney movies grow up learning that main characters don’t look like me. Adults watch movies learning that, too.
I was going to specify which trait I’m talking about, but it doesn’t matter. Just know there’s a whole underbelly of isms that aren’t talked about or stigmatized, but still damage lives."

"I read the secret about the Comic Sans font and literally felt stabbed in my heart. This makes me feel like I care too much about aesthetic and reminded me of this: I broke up with my last boyfriend because I met him during the winter but summer came around and he started wearing cargo shorts. I literally felt less attracted to him and couldn't continue on. I feel like I need help because I'm too shallow."
[.C]
"If you prefer someone who takes pride in their appearance there's really nothing wrong with that. A bit harsh, but it's about the line you draw. Yours is at cargo shorts. Other people's may be at simply showering."
[.P]
"Today, I had two of my best friends respectively cut me off. The first one told me he never cared about me, and the second one told me I was selfish, even though I comforted him after he sexually assaulted me. I can't tell if I'm unlucky or the world's worst person."
[.C]
"Let’s not overdramatize the situation. Two people don’t want to be your friend anymore. Life goes on. It doesn’t sound like you’re losing anything here. I’m a little doubtful of that sexual assault claim. Why would you comfort someone who just assaulted you?"

"I said a dude was handsome once like 2 weeks ago and now all my friends are literally pressuring me into being gay. They say things like "maybe you just don't know it yet" or "why don't you just try it?". Um maybe cuz I don't like men? I know they're trying to be supportive especially in this new social climate but enough is enough. I know I'm def not the most masculine guy and I've def had people mistake me for gay before, but if I say I'm not gay I'm not fucking gay and people need to stop needling me about it."

"I'm a straight guy and I'm legitimately confused as to what I'm supposed to be doing to support feminism in response to the "me too" movement. I feel like if I continue to just listen like they ask me to do then I get scrutinized for not taking any action, but then when I try to speak out in favor of faminsim, or actively try to promote the ideals and beliefs, I'm seen as a pseudo-feminist who isn't really able to understand what I'm talking about. I've talked to my female friends about ideas that I have to try to make a change and all I get is conflicting opinions saying that I shouldn't try to do anything as it would draw attention away from what matters, but then I constantly hear that it's time for men to do something. That's all I want to do, is to do something that will show women that men understand and are there to help without coming off as fake or taking the attention away from the issue at hand. Women, I'm on your side and I want to do something, but I just don't know what to do."
[.C]
"The thing is that you can’t actually win in the world of neoliberal identity politics - anything you do or don’t do will be wrong. For this reason, I recommend thinking for yourself and ignoring the obscurantist nonsense that tells you that being a man somehow renders you incapable of doing so. Take a position, argue it, and fight for it. Those who tell you you’re not allowed to, either ignore them or try to get them to say something substantive about the issue. Be open, of course, to having your mind changed, but don’t let yourself be straightjacketed into thinking your identity somehow makes you incapable of thinking critically."

"I'm a Jew and I'm pro-Palestine. As much as I want to get involved with SJP, I can't because my family will disown me. I wish that more people would realize how intertwined this issue has become to Judaism itself. In hebrew school, we learned that Palestinians were evil murderers. Anyone who even asked for the other side of the story was severely punished. I hate that I feel like I have to choose between my Jewish identity and my political beliefs."
[.C]
"Hi Op. I organize with Jewish Voice for Peace, too. We SO understand what you're experiencing. The mainstream Jewish discourse leaves little room for pro-Palestine Jewish discourse, but that's where we come in! As the Jewish wing of the Palestinian Solidarity Movement, we are inspired by our Judaism to fight for justice in Palestine! Please feel free to reach out to me via private message if you want to talk some more."

"I was drunk at a friend's house. Her roommate - a boy - offered to take me upstairs to his bedroom so I could sleep. He said he would sleep on the couch downstairs. But still, I wouldn't go with him until my other friend - a girl - went with me to make sure I was ok.
In the morning, I woke up and almost apologized to my friend's roommate because I felt I had made him feel awkward.
But I didn't apologize to him. While I'm sure he had no intention to harm me, I had no guarantee of that because as a woman, I've been conditioned to fear men's actions.
I'm thankful for my friend's roommate for being kind. He's a sweet guy. But if I had a dollar for every time a sweet guy turned out to be not so sweet, well, I'd obviously be very, very rich.
No more apology culture. Men, you've made this name for yourselves. Now fucking fix it."
[.C]
"Wow, all the comments on here are stupid. She’s not entitled. She’s cautious because women have to deal with creepy shit from men constantly, so she didn’t go sleep in this random guy’s bed alone just to be safe. If she had slept in the bed and been assaulted by him, the same people would be commenting that she should have been more cautious and slept somewhere else."
[.P]
"I don’t like judging people’s choices, but it really sucks to walk by a smoker because I have asthma. Whenever I’m stuck walking behind or standing next to someone who’s smoking and my throat starts to seize up, I can’t help hoping karma gets them back later."
[.C]
"Nah, smoking openly in the middle of a busy pedestrian pathway is rude, it’s okay to judge people who do that."

"I got into a section of a language class where everyone else is from the same class beforehand, and I’m not into side talks during class (it wastes the professor’s time, and my money that I’m paying for the class). So I made a brilliant plan of doing a social experiment where I act like a complete asshole Sternie stereotype just in that class to gauge my classmates’ reactions, like making all my answers business related. It’s been entertaining as hell so far. I noticed that LS and Tisch students react/laugh at me the most, where CAS students are the most neutral. I look forward for my class every day to be the best asshole. It’s fantastic."
[.C]
"You're not a Sternie asshole, you're just a plain asshole. Stop stereotyping an entire group of students. We are all not the same. Your actions are likely impacting many of your peers negatively and that's not right."

"A few months ago, I was sexually assaulted. I was heartbroken, disappointed and for some time, unsure of how to cope. Long story short, I decided to channel my anger and sadness into many of the mental health/wellness initiatives I've launched through this page, in the hopes that they would maybe help someone who had experienced something similar. If you've ever been sexually harassed, sexually assaulted or raped, please know that you're never alone, that time heals all wounds, and that help is out there."

"Fml right now. I’ve been slacking off in school for the past four years because I thought that one day I would inherit close to a billion dollars in assets from my dad. Come to find out the fool just had another child at the age of 67 with his 20 year old mistress, who I am now probably going to share my inheritance with. Now instead of everything going to me it's more than likely going to be split three ways. This is so messed up, idk what to do."

"In my culture, it's standard for a son to give his first month's payment to his mom. I live at home and it's something my older brother did, and so did my dad with his mom. It honestly felt pretty crappy to do the wire transfer, since my parents recently just spend money freely and I know they're just going to use it to buy some more shit we don't need. I'm scared that this first payment will become standard, as proof that I am capable of continuously paying for my parents while I live under their roof. I'm even more scared I'll never be able to save up enough (exactly why I stayed at home in the first place after graduating) to move out somewhere worthwhile. Why should I feel obligated to do so much more for my parents than they ever did for theirs?."
(This secret was brought to you by daddy issues)"

"I'm a commuter student and I live with my parents in their apartment on the Upper East Side. Last night, I brought home my boyfriend, thinking my parents wouldn't be home until late. After a few drinks, me and the guy start hooking up in the living room and things get really steamy. Literally the moment I yell out "Oh yes, daddy!" the front door swings open and my father, who doesn't know I'm gay walks in. We haven't spoken since. FML."

"If you were ever thinking about taking exams at the Moses center, I discourage you to do so. The environment is horrible and you are constantly being watched on cameras. They have falsely accused me of cheating twice. Their justification? I dropped a napkin and that apparently looked suspicious on cameras. I now have to deal with a number of staff members to prove my innocence. How are they helping people with learning disabilities if all they are doing is alleviating anxiety? The same goes for the Wellness exchange. The amount of times I have been dismissed, told to sleep on it etc. Seriously NYU. If you were easier to sue, I would be a fucking billionaire."
[.C]
"This is absolutely terrible advice to anyone who has a disability and needs testing services. You should not discourage people from self-advocating and getting the resources and services they need."

"As a proud Sternie who sees the anti-Stern sentiment on this page and feels incredible sad about it ... why does everyone hate us? We're following our passions, just like the rest of you. A majority of us came here to learn about business so that we can try to do good and make a difference in the world in the ways that we can - is that so bad?"

"My quiet, religiously conservative roommate got a girlfriend a few weeks ago. They hang out in our room a lot which is fine, they're pretty chill, and the first time he asked about her staying over I thought nothing of it, having heard his spiel about his faith and devotion to celibacy until marriage. Fast forward to last night when I wake up at 3am to take a piss, and hear creaking bedsprings and muffled, awkward moans from 5 feet away. Never in my life have I wished harder for a Polaroid camera, because I would've framed the look of sheer horror in his moonlit eyes."

"I've been dating a girl for almost two years now. I'm a mixed-race POC and she's aryan as fuck. Today, after acting oddly standoffish and squeamish for a few months, she left me, saying that she just couldn't date someone who was non white anymore, because apparently there are things POC can't understand. I'm livid and heartbroken and entirely disappointed. I really thought I was going to spend my life with this girl, and over the span of a few months, she turns into a white nationalist. Why does it take so long for some people's true colors to come out?"
[.C]
"Sounds like you're better off without her. She sounds like a terrible human being at heart and her true colors emerged. I hope you find someone more deserving of your affection"
[.P]
"Being celibate in this school (and college in general) has been rougher than I anticipated. My friends constantly base conversations on sex stories, and I can't do much else other than nod and smile. People either tease me or respect me for keeping my virginity. Experiences on dating apps haven't been the best, since delayed sex or no sex doesn't sit well with most people. It's come to the point where I don't even want to bother with dating anymore. This isn't a knock on sexually-active people -- all the power to y'all. I don't plan on changing my stance, but I can't help but feeling like an outsider, socially and romantically."

"When I was in high school I was really into God and saving myself for marriage (which is odd because gay marriage wasn't even legal yet) and I called myself the celibacy queen"

"Last semester my professor told us during our second to last class that we need to email our final papers to her as class is cancelled because she is having her baby. We all were soooo shook and literally thought she was joking. Plot twist, she was pregnant the entire time. I was sipping the coffee that made me late (meme reference) and actually choked on it. The class tried to backtrack and act like we knew, but it we were too far gone. She literally said, “I can’t believe you guys thought I was just fat.” Sis tried to play it off, but when she was grading our final papers she definitely took each of our reactions into account. Moral of the story is: if a professor is making an announcement, put all liquids down."[.C]
