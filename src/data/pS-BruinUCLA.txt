"I wish I could go back in time and protect myself from the pain, trauma, and abuse I ended up experiencing from my ex-gf as well as my ex-best friend.
Even though I try to remind myself that it isn’t shameful to be caring and empathetic, I nonetheless feel so much regret, shame, and disappointment, and I am haunted every day by PTSD from betrayal, assault, and heartbreak.
Although I feel some measure of pride and relief that I am the type of person to take ownership of my mistakes and learn from them, I am disgusted and terrified for the people they interact with, because they definitely aren’t.
Personally, I’m exhausted by other people’s bullshit. I disapprove of doubting people by default, but definitely, if someone is actually showing conflicting signals, even if it’s subtle, please listen to your instincts and drop/drift away from the person ASAP to save yourself some heartache. Like yes, no one is wholly good or bad, but there’s a distinct line beteeen character quirks / weaknesses and flaws that tend to result in abusive, toxic, and/or invalidating behavior. I’m still trying to be cognizant of this myself so that I’m not too forgiving in the future.
P.S. I’m going to give one identifying demographic - I’m female. Just to bring attention to the queer community and so that people don’t automatically assume I’m male because I mention an ex-gf. But yeah. Abuse and sexual harassment / assault happen between two women as well (and naturally, between other genders too)."

"Hello does anyone here suffer from depersonalisation/ derealisation? Basically it is the feeling of disconnect from yourself and other and reality. Like watching a movie of yourself. People usually have similar feelings when high or drunk. 
From what I hear people usually get it from lack of social interaction/ being alone.
I just got this a few weeks ago and it is the scariest thing ever. I look into the mirror and my family members and dont recognise them. It has made my stress levels and anxiety to skyrocket past what they already are and made it hard to eat and i am losing a lot of weight. 
Ive never though of myself as antisocial but I stopped socialising to many people so I could just focus on my schoolwork about a year ago. I got better grades and was eating better but now this happened and im scared to death. 
When I talk to people it gets slightly better but I dont know anyone well enough to have long conversations with over many days.(basically a friend).
Would anyone out there who has or does not have this be willing to talk to me/ get lunch for a while or let me join there friend group to help me break out of this?(basically do friend things and talk and stuff)
Im not one to write stuff like this but I am very scared and alone right now and I have no one else to turn to. Hopefully some bruins out there can help out a fellow bruin. And only comment if you want to actually help me because I really need help."

"Unless a medical professional says otherwise, and since nobody else has said it: please go to CAPS and/or the Ashe Clinic. That symptom definitely seems alarming to me."

"I'm here to be messaged to as well. I usually hear about it as dissociation, but I've been experiencing it my whole life and am totally cool with talking to you and introducing you to people."

"Hey, I've experienced this a lot as well. There are actually a lot of ways to "re-ground" yourself back. It is hard to do but can be overcome. If you want to,I am down to hang and get food. Shoot me a message? Its pretty scary at first but don't be too alarmed, you are not alone."
