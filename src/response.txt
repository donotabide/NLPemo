Unfortunately, you can't hide from pain, trauma or abuse. Try to learn from your experience, avoid situations where you feel like your friends are taking advantage of you and stand your ground. You are not weak, you are learning.

I empathize with you on this OP - best of luck in your future.

Unless a medical professional says otherwise, and since nobody else has said it: please go to CAPS and/or the Ashe Clinic. That symptom definitely seems alarming to me.

This is unfortunately a very common problem nowadays. I've been there. I felt like my family could't recognize me after long periods of isolation in school. It is scary because it is new, and also alarming. Socialization is necessary for a healthy brain. Make sure to engage on friendships, listen and empathize with your friends.

I feel you, as an immigrant I can say that many of us are treated like second class citizens. I'm one of the DACA dreamers and I had to deal with similar occurrences. It is revolting and she is the devil!

To those who have hit rock bottom or feel like they're losing their minds or are bearing the weight of each day on their shoulders or are bearing the weight of loneliness in their heavy hearts, others feel it too. You are not alone. Scream until you're listened to. Scream until your pain is heard. It's easier to feel your bones shake and to break down in the office of a psychiatrist than it is to wear the same disguise of everything is okay when nothing is right. And it's fine if other people find out that you aren't okay because one day you will be. Maybe not now. Maybe not tomorrow. But one day you will be. That's how getting better works. It's a process. Go talk to your doctor or your insurance company or walk into urgent care and say you need help. Do what you need to do to get better and that ALWAYS involves getting help from others.

I'm here to be messaged to as well. I usually hear about it as dissociation, but I've been experiencing it my whole life and am totally cool with talking to you and introducing you to people.

Hey, I've experienced this a lot as well. There are actually a lot of ways to re-ground yourself back. It is hard to do but can be overcome. If you want to,I am down to hang and get food. Shoot me a message? Its pretty scary at first but don't be too alarmed, you are not alone.

Going to premed is not easy and requires some level of isolation, which results in what you are describing. Why don't you try to study with friends or classmates?
c
:( I can help :) just feel free to message me. I would love to talk. Hopefully I can be of some help to you.

Hi, always here to talk if you want someone to vent to or need support<3

I’m not a Bruin, so sorry if that disqualifies me, but I am hear to talk, send me a message!

Give yourself permission to take a break! You are a lovely individual and your major (and uni as a whole, really) wants you to feel your major is your only source of worth. Please continue to do the good and wonderful work that you do. But schedule (please for the love of everything, schedule it so you can look forward to it!) five hours a week to watch that new show with friends, do that dance workshop, joke with the wine club, and reclaim your personality.

OP speaks of the unspoken. At least they realize that the future can happen, but does take initiative to plan and anticipates.

Rock bottom is the best place to build a strong foundation for a glorious future :) Just have to keep on trucking!

So sorry to hear that life had been tough. Let me see if I have your story straight. You feel worthless because of your personality, ie a core part of you that you feel you cannot change. You think that people would not like or want to be friends with you. You probably stick to yourself and not actively try to make friends or you do and you fail. This makes you feel worthless again and continues the loop. Your feels, thoughts, and behavior is conspiring against you. This is a classic example a downward spiral. Please visit CAPS at your next convenience. Once you see your therapist, tell then that you are spiraling. They will help you. Your problem is not small. It is growing but it can be nipped in the bud. You sound motivated to change and really self aware, so I know you can do this!

First, I am so sorry that you are going through this. I have dealt with many similar feelings that you are going through right now. In the past I’ve struggled to have a sense of self-worth and self-confidence, and though I have gotten better these feelings still persist to an extent today. Second, I want to assure you that things, though will take time, will get better, even if you may not feel so. Trust me, I’ve felt that way a lot too, where I thought things would not get better. But as long as you try to make things better, even if they are small steps, trust me, they will get better. Lastly, I want to assure you that you are worthy of being here, and no one deserves to feel how you are feeling. Please feel free to message me if you want to talk. Also I encourage you to try out CAPS, but I understand if you don’t find it helpful (I personally didn’t find it that helpful for me as I prefer to talk to friends or at least peers about my problems).

It is a shame your self worth is so low. But, it doesnt have to be. Your life and your attitude towards it is self determined. If you have a shitty personality, change it to a pleasant one. Personality is a choice not something that you inherited. A true friend requires work. So, work on it. Talk about them only. Ask them questions. Soon enough, they will take a real interest in you. Dont think suicide ever. You can do this because it isn’t that hard. It is simply a choice to be made. Good luck.

LSD/MDMA can bring out both anhedonia and depression but I don't believe it can not cause it. You should consider that just because you didn't notice before, doesn't mean you it wasn't there. I've been suicidal since I was a child and in fact LSD helped me with some of it. I don't have a good advice about stopping your depression since I can't stop my own. I just accepted it, somedays I will be sad, somedays I will be happy, someday I am both. Consider that this might just be you growing up and knowing a bit more of yourself.

'Things will get better'. Let me tell you this is the biggest lie in the history of lies. People tell me this all the time--when I'm having suicidal thoughts, after a suicide attempt, and even when I'm strapped to a hospital bed. They've told me this after they learned how I was destroyed as a child by other people. They are wrong. Things are the same.
What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

To Whom it May Concern, Here is a skit idea for Spring Sing this year: a classic old-timey western movie gun fight scene set in the middle of bruin walk but instead of guns they use bananas. w/ love, A banana loving undergrad

Ends with someone from Covel scolding you for taking more than one banana?

I know things will work out for you eventually. If you continue taking classes at a local college and bring your GPA up again, you can always re-apply to UCLA or an equivalent prestigious university. So many good stories of people redeeming themselves so I know it's not the end for ya. Good luck - H

Trust me, there are a lot of people in the world that might have the exact same sense of dirty humor, you just have to take the risk to talk to them and not feel insecure. The fact that you never had a boyfriend is overwhelming but it doesn't define you.

...The good news: it's even simpler than that. Obviously it'll vary based on the circumstances some, but basically you just have to fill out the readmission application, talk to an adviser, and make a contract about how many classes you can take and when and what grades you need to achieve, etc. ... And then you enroll in your classes like usual (usually through UNEX in what's called concurrent enrollment) and move on. **Disclaimer: I am not an academic adviser... I just have far, far too much personal experience with this. XD**

I think a good way to look at it is to think of how it can become a great inspirational story once you bounce back! Keep at it and don't give up! One day you will be able to tell your story to inspire those who may be in your shoes in the future or maybe even now

Don't let this one setback define you! Keep fighting to get back up!

These secrets really freak me out that would be my worst nightmare

I hope things get better for you

While you have no reason to listen to this, you don't know me and you seem to be very set in your decision, please don't kill yourself. Depression and anhedonia are terrible, and living with them is horrible but please give it some more time. This is a brain injury, not unlike a concussion or a stroke and it takes time to heal. The brain is incredibly slow at healing itself. It often takes months and several different medications before you find the right one to mitigate the symptoms for you. Please, just don't give up so soon. While memory loss is better than suicide, the possibility of being able to feel happiness is even better than that. Just a little more time OP, for your friends, your family, but most importantly for yourself. You can get through this. Let the people around you support you and if you need more than that, we can change the first sentence I said and you can message me. I'm no one special, just willing to be a friend if you need another.

Also a lot people on here are acting like trolls and the mods should crack down and ban them. Suicide is no laughing matter, shame on them. Makes me disgusted to go to the same school as them.

2 months isn't very long in terms of recovering from a brain injury.

This is like saying I had 0% runny nose before the cold and I will NOT accept a runny nose. Deal with the circumstances you have now. Not before.

Do you do anything at all to manage your depression other than hoping group therapy, therapy, and meds will do something for you? If you're too tired to do anything else and you're feeling suicidal, it's time to check yourself into a hospital. I recommend Ronald Reagan if you have the UCLA insurance. Their service is great and the staff is lovely. You deserve to be alive. You deserve to see a smile one day in your reflection and feel it mirrors the joy you will one day have again.

studies have shown that CBT over a long period of time will change your brain chemistry in the same ways that meds do. it does work, but its not a miracle cure all that will instantly solve all your problems. you need to put the work in if you want to get better.

If the therapy isn't working, then start running around the campus. Run to Wilshire, and then back up Veteran if you have to. Make strategic Spotify playlists to lift your mood while you run. It's good to run in the morning, and gaze at the horizon. Anhedonia is just apathy and insatiability, it's common to feel this way. You can tap into your subtle body and stimulate that which you're repressing. The brain is malleable, and nerves can heal themselves. Steve Jobs did acid to btw.

Does the realization of the absurd require suicide?

You talk about yourself as a decent person with decent qualities, but likeable is not one of them. Would you find yourself likeable at all? Could you expect people to like you if you imagine scenarios of people not liking you, as you are in effect actively finding reasons to not like yourself? Are you being too hard on yourself by defining likeable as having the approval of people who will genuinely like me, text me, and email me whenever I message them? Is it more assumable to think that keeping to yourself too much is making it hard for people to find things in common with you?

Acquiring true friends takes a lot of work. Most people don't take the time to filter out those who really don't fit their life. So, I would recommend taking a close look at your acquaintences and figure out who you think would add value to your life. Then, carefully but frequently, invite them personally (not an email or text) to get together with you for a meal or a drink. Then, when you're together, focus exclusively on that person. Ask about their interests, their likes and dislikes etc. If they ask about you, answer simply without long explanations. They will react very positively to that experience and you'll be well on your way to creating a very special bond with them. If you see a guy to whom you are attracted, just be very nice to him and he'll soon get the idea that you're interested. Good luck!

all these false priests and charlatan of eCONomists use their unrealistic assumptions like perfect rationality and self interested actors to maintain the dominance of the rootless capitalist rent seekers by spreading the twisted sick dogma of neoliberalism. there was this one time i read an article on behavioral economics so it's pretty clear to me the whole field is a sham.

Act as if you suspect nothing. You don't have any 'ammunition' to use to do anything other than trying your best to get through the class and into another professor's class who will likely also do the same. Life is the way it is and it is difficult to change individually. Most individuals in a postion to do something are unwilling to go out on a limb so they perpetuate the discrimination. Take a deep breath and plug on. You'll be ok.

I might be wrong but this seems like good practice for the field you are going to be in. Politics and law isn't for the thin-skinned.

Justin Ambrosio thought this was you until I realized you don't eat gelato or maybe but def not mini golf

That's adorable. Good luck OP <3

this aint about me but imma act like it's about me to make my night better cuz I wear glasses and am a boy and also was in Kerckhoff at some point in this month.

Melody Lim u already know

Kira O'Connor Not sure if it's you but you certainly fit the bill so maybe? also OP, I don't think it's weird. They're students just like you are :P But maybe be careful about asking out the RA if they're for your floor until next year, /just/ in case it goes south.

I tried it before, but failed terribly. For me, not worth it.

Its Anthony DiChiara and christina Alex Negulescu Nick Semo PJ Negulescu John Takiff

Getting the guy to talk to her is only going to make things worse.

Having the guy talk to her is not going to help.

do you think you could get her to get some professional help as well?
having the guy talk to her could just be a temporary fix, so getting help at CAPS or something would be better to get at the root of the problem

I dont think at this point she is strong enough to confront with him again.... He is a sad memory that she wants to get rid of her life... Breaking up is a hard issue and only her can help herself. :( May be you suggest her to share this with someone who she trusts, like her Mom or her best friends. That will help!

Hey Friend! You've lost a lot of weight since I last saw you and now I'm really worried. I think you need to get professional help ASAP. I not doing anything until seven, so can we walk in together? We can grab some dinner together afterwards too.

I'll talk to her Alice Lee. I'll get her to eat more

Shagufah Ajmal BURHHH I thought you wrote this about me AHHAHAHAH

That is a terrible way to grow up! However, it is now your choice as to how you want it to affect your life. You can be a victim forever if you choose. Or, you can get it behind you if you choose. I think you should seek professional assistance and over time, put your past behind you and be the courageous, trusting woman you were meant to be. And, don’t be afraid to talk about your past and don’t be shamed by it. Take a deep breath and take the first step to getting past this.

Best wishes. Hopefully your current interest will be understanding of your situation and it will last? :) I don't know if you've talked to them about your concerns, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try

Why in the world do you care what they do.....? So what? Maybe he has mental issues, maybe he's struggling and you don't even know and here you are judging them

Find an equally unsocial girl and maybe they can get together

He probably has the best grades in the building though. Maybe he just wants a good future.. lol.

This was me last year but you should talk to your roommate more.

The problem as you said is you THINK. Thinking is a very good thing, and it also can be a big trouble depending on circumstances. Good luck.

Sounds like someone finally reached puberty.. The hormones are starting to rage!

This is so wholesome. I love this. And, it is a crush!

I read this in a pirate accent.

all the guys I talk to Likely a case of sampling bias. Consider modifying the sampling methodology.

If all the guys you talk to are like that, then you might be hanging out in an area with a high concentration of thirsty guys. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy thing, since you're not exactly going to meet people who study at home on Thursday nights.

Michael McCallion Benjamin Ihlefeld me whenever I start trying to be friends with guys in my classes I just want to be friends goddammit!

I feel this too. You aren’t alone. Great friends, it’s still not enough. Be careful who you make deeper connections with, because when they stop being your friend, it really hurts. I hope you find what you need

Well... it's hard to make really deep connections to people. But you can only ever keep trying :) I'm down if you want~

I miss the deep conversations too. Message me and i would love to do something with you sometime :)

Nonsense. You just need proper stimulation. Until it comes along, keep putting one foot in front of another and sooner rather than later, you'll recover what you think you've lost.

Lost it perhaps, but there may come a day that someone can help you find it again :) Until then, don't give up hope!

 Austin Lee I know we've been friends for four years but I can't keep it in any more

When you said she saved your life several times, it seems like a red flag. Maybe she wanted to be a partner, not a savior.

“The only girl I have wanted all of 2017” my god it must’ve been such a tragedy for you knowing you didn’t want her in 2016. And what about 2015? Why stop there? Lets include 2014 and 2013? Jesus dude it’s a girl, quit being a fucking bitch. Maybe that’s why she left you, you sound really beta. Lol

Life has its way of being unexpected - and that goes for both you and her. Based on your description, I imagine it was hard for her, too - but she has to do what she has to do for herself. My condolences for how you feel, and best wishes moving forward.

I know it seems tough now --- but it will get better pretty quickly. Just keep your eyes open as you walk through the campus and I'm sure you'll see a number of women who will take your mind off of your last girlfriend. And, be grateful for the fact she broke up earlier rather than later because the longer it goes on, the more difficult it is to get out.

If It worked out for Aria and Ezra, it could work out for you and him

By all means, don't hesitate. After the quarter is over, go talk to him and let him know.

I think that particular person might just be that way. Sometimes people get harassed a lot by others propositioning them for sex - it's a defense mechanism to then be mean as a default state. Please don't let this deter you from continuing to hit people up as a friend :)

It doesn't sound like they're your friend, or like this response was totally out of the blue. If a person isn't interested in talking to you, you should be able to recognize it long before it gets to the point of such a blunt interaction.

the fact that the other person reached out to you is a good sign!! sometimes u just gotta remind them casually like Hey u wanna grab dinner this wk? etc. also perhaps theyre busy with midterms but little gestures like that i definitely appreciate :)

Just gotta find other people - don't rely on one person! :) Good luck

These are some typical symptoms of depression. Go to CAPS and talk with a counselor.

hey, you do you if you're okay with being alone, but remember that not everyone can do that. it would be nice if I didn't get lonely, but I get lonely to the point of severe, impactful depression. that's not something I can just easily be okay with. so think before you say something like that so offhandedly

Honestly this is what I've been saying for ages. I love eating with friends when I can, but I have 0 issues eating alone.

If you have jesus, are you ever really alone

You do realize there's a difference between being alone and being lonely right?

I'm so sorry you had that experience. :( Both someone saying that.

If it's any consolation at all, generally someone saying that is a pretty terrible person, and you may not have ended up in a healthy situation with them.

That's some incredible quotation etiquette there

Some people are hella immature. My advice is to just leave it. You can dive deep into the rabbit hole of psychology and never understand some things, it's not worth it. My guess is that she realized you're starting to like her, but she doesn't like you, and doesn't want to confront the awkwardness of talking to you about it. Or something like that. Another possibility is she met another guy and he doesn't like her hanging around you all the time. Or she wants to focus on schoolwork and finds hanging out with you distracting. Honestly, there's a million such variations but they all mean the same thing: Don't get attached to people until you know them for sure.
P.S. Spoken from experience.

Her reasons aren’t important. Her actions are and she, for whatever reason, doesn’t want you close to her. Accept it and be glad that you found out before you developed strong feelings for her.

Move on. She won't tell you what is on her mind and you can't read her mind. These people aren't worth the time. Go out and make some real friends.

just tell them. Like you could say something like Hey I like jokes, but that one about death is just inappropriate. its awkward at first. But letting them know is better than leaving them in ignorance and you feeling uncomfortable.

You could always seek out understanding friends or consult with CAPS. My condolences and best wishes.

Perhaps talk to them about how you feel? If they're your friends they should understand and be willing to tone down the joking

I felt that way too as a freshman (and even part of my sophomore year) but it gets better over time! People can only hang on to their high school friends for so long. It may feel lonely right now but keep trying and eventually you will find people who will want to spend time with you. You're not alone. :)

Felt the same way. Learned to fly solo. Became badass. Then found stuff I valued more than friendship. Like ponies. Then I found real friends.

Thank you for having the courage to speak up. It is not your fault. You are not alone. There are many resources on campus for when you feel ready to talk, and I'm here as well. Don't go through it alone. CARE: http://www.careprogram.ucla.edu/

I’m so sorry this happened to you Please report this though. This guy could be harassing other women as well. Also remember the resources at school that provide therapy and such.

I feel for this women but i have a few questions. Why didnt you stop him in when he ran his hand down your leg?how did he manipulate you to go to your room then have sex ? Then you continued to have sex with him ?? Its not like he forced her to do anything. There seems to be two individuals with issues and problems

Whoever wrote this please message me. I'm afraid I might have had the same experience with this person.

Who raped you?

Why do you want good grades? Grades are just one of the indicators for how well you know the material of a class. It was designed to fit everybody, so in reality it fits no one. It is by far not the only indicator for how good you are in your field. It's up to you how much importance you want to prescribe to it. I was never a great studier or a fast learner, so I had a lower GPA than most of my friends. But for me, school wasn't about grades. School was an opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn, and a degree was just a stepping stone to future jobs. So I didn't stress so much about my grades, paid attention to the classes I liked, and focused the rest of my energy on personal projects. I never even put my GPA on my resume, my projects filled the gap, and I landed decent internships (tho some companies did ask for my GPA. I stopped caring about such closed-minded companies). Point is, there are so many other ways to get a job, like networking or doing research or getting recs. School isn't all about grades, it means whatever you want it to mean. So figure out what you want to get out of it, focus on what you're good at, and don't waste your four years trying to meet other people's standards.

Honestly, it takes a lot to get good grades here. If you have any sort of social life or a job, I'm amazed if you do well. I stress out and have mini breakdowns every quarter.. just do your best and don't let it kill you. Also, don't snort the adderall.. I know it's more fun, but it doesn't work the way it is supposed to if you snort it.. hope that helps. Lol.

 I disagree. I've found that if required tasks lead to procrastination, then - potential mental health issues aside - maybe you don't really want to do the thing, and should consider options which you actually enjoy doing (this is especially applicable to significant others). This is the only life you get, and your youth is fleeting - I promise that if you spend it disciplining yourself into following a path you're not enthusiastic about, you'll just grow to be a bitter and hateful adult who never stops wondering what if?

Best create opportunities from here. That being said, it will take time. Dont mean to be hard, but mentality shifts when we are either in stress or feeling good. Never feel like you are holding yourself back. Do what you can do and feel bad if you are late bloomer at the same time. Individually, your determination can offer a lot more.

Damn I could easily have been the one to write this. Same exact situation (down to the GPA), same drive. Best of luck to you, you're not alone.

dont compare yourself to your 3.8 counterparts or you are gonna be sad forever. Accept yourself for who you are and move on. Do a post- bac and dont look bac - bb

I just met a woman who graduated from UCSF med school after completing her MPH at Johns Hopkins. BUT she did all of that after taking 4 gap years because she graduated from UCLA with a 2.6 GPA. In those gap years she worked on research that she was really passionate about. As long as you pursue your passions and really show growth in your gap years, anything is possible. If you really want to be a doctor, you will be. Perseverance is the epitome of the medical journey. Good luck, stay strong, and stay motivated. You'll get there. and. don't. compare. yourself. to. others.

AAMC provides financial aid thru their Finacial Assistance Program that gives you reduced price in MCAT fees and free year subscription for MSAR (provides full admission stats for med schools). For your grade, look into post bacc/SMP/master programs!! Each program have their pros and cons, but you pretty much need to prove that you can handle a full academic load AND do well. I'm recent physiology major grad who graduated and currently enrolled at CSULA's academic enhancer post bacc. I'm doing really well and will most likely raise my gpa by 0.2!!! It's ok to take time and get it right, even if you already graduated. Good luck to you and anyone else

People can give constructive advices.... but reality is.... you have little to no chance to get into good med schools with a 3.0 GPA! I am not sure about schools in states like Kentucky or Kansas though . Maybe go for master first! Or post bacc to improve your GPA! Or get into research! Theres also other good paying health professions available such as pa, nursing, dentistry, radiology, etc! Good luck

 I would suggest trying your best to ace the MCAT and applying broadly (may be consider DO schools). They can’t accept you if you don’t apply. So if your dream of becoming a doctor is big enough, you should try your best in subsequent steps and apply! Good luck!

No matter how much you may think your peers have over you, realize that the strangers on the application-evaluation committee (and in the job market) have seen dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of applicants in the past that're better than all of you - and they know from experience that numbers are not people. Sell yourself - in writing and in person. There is more substance to every person than can be notated on an application, and it's your job to show the remaining bits of who you are - and THOSE bits are the ones that will matter most, in the end.

You are going to need to really kill a postgrad program. It is definitely not worth it to apply as is.

Good luck to you :)

I think you should stop this i havent met the one type of mindset. Everyone you meet, in your classes, in your clubs, in your whatever, has the potential to be your friend or best friend. There are some relationships that on paper should've been a match made in heaven for friendship and they should've ended up being each other's best man or bridesmaid. But if you just expect things to fall into place and that friendship to grow then you're wholly mistaken by how friendships are even formed in the first place. There are some friends out there that have nothing in common but still somehow stay friends, because they worked at it, they kept at each other's lives and learned how to be friends with each other.

I think everyone finds friends differently. Perhaps you find a friend by posting to the UCLA Secrets page and friend-ifying commenters? :) *hint hint*

Good luck to your cousin.

Stupid.

Love reacts only please.

Pretty sure OP is talking about the Anime class I'm in. I was so surprised when no one said anything. I guess the last 30 minutes of magical-schoolgirl-in-Feudal-China shojo were enough to crush everyone's spirit lmao.

It would've prevented the John Podesta hack, and thus might've changed the outcome of the election. Need any more to convince you?

Jesus was born in Judea (Western Asia) so he technically was Asian lmfao

What the fuck. 1. This was my party. 2. This was my dildo (that was brand new by the way) 3. I DIDN'T POST THIS SO SOMEONE AT THE PARTY IS PRETENDING TO BE ME.

Is it about his mom though?

is this straight culture

Cuter hotter better and then some. Just tryna help a sister out

Then wait till after graduation. I know that sucks but they can’t exactly take their tuition money back after that.

Im a flaming feminist and Im here for you. This system hurts men and doesn't allow them much emotional release. A feminist who wants to see a better world realizes the pain of everyone. I'm sorry if others have made you feel discounted. There are so many opinions out there these days it's hard for good ones to be heard. I hope others don't discourage you from telling your story. I wish you peace

Statistically, even if this happened ten times, there isn't even a one percent chance a NYU student wouldn't be one of those hit by the car. I wouldn't send out a letter either

Senpai in the streets. Kawaii in the sheets

My advice, ignore all the commenters here who clearly don't have sympathy for victims of abuse and speak to a therapist while doing some serious math on what your expenses and income potential is. Parental abuse and neglect is real and so is the financial decision to give up thousands and thousands of dollars. If they are really abusive, they know that paying for your college puts you in their debt, and paying for it yourself will put you in debt to the bank/government. There isn't one answer for this but I hope you figure out what's best for you.

If you prefer someone who takes pride in their appearance there's really nothing wrong with that. A bit harsh, but it's about the line you draw. Yours is at cargo shorts. Other people's may be at simply showering.

Don't make yourself double upset for not studying

We are here to support you

Sounds like you're better off without her. She sounds like a terrible human being at heart and her true colors emerged. I hope you find someone more deserving of your affection

And this is why you shouldn't take classes that involve writing papers.

Whenever I feel sad or super overwhelmed with life, I go to my professor's office hours and somehow he always makes me feel better. This is why I feel like North Campus professors are better than South Campus ones, because they care about both students' learning and wellbeing. Friends are a great support system too, but sometimes if my friend is having a rough week too, I dont want to unburden myself on her. Therefore, I'm so glad to have found a support system in my professors at UCLA. They really make me want to learn and be a better person too.  #uclasecretsprofessors #uclasecretssupport

The fact that she is no longer into hanging with you means that you might need sometime alway from each other to discover more about yourself/herself. Find new circles of friendships and other people who feel like they need to hang

First of all if you decided to almost kill urself only after being rejected by a school, you gotta reevaluate your life. Happy for you but you got issues

First mistake: when you're being involved with the community and other work opportunities it should be because you're personally interested in participating not for a resume boost!! Second mistake: you're privilege just to have the opportunity to study at a UC when many other people don't. But glad you made the best of your situation and found "happiness" wherever you be at. Go Bears!!!

That is quite the story

I'm married and eloped. Most of his family and our friend don't know. If you need someone to talk too, I'm here!

It is very brave of you to share the bad things happened to you and expressed your emotion entirely. Childhood does have a big influence on your mental health. You are not alone, many people have gone through Cal with depression, like me as a psych major. i was lucky to have friends who know about depression or went through similar problems together. not everyone could understand symptoms of depression and say things to make u feel better, but they do want to help you (except your Dad who might make it worse) try to talk to anyone from psych major, im sure they are, or even i am, happy to talk with you. Make good use of Tang Center, and campus counselling services like Student to Student Peer Counselling, they are on phone or in person. :) Go little Cal Bear, you will be great!

Whatever you do, don't "just wait" for people to change-they never do! (At least not in the ways you are expecting). Ask yourself what your requirements are for a relationship. Once your standards for quality time, affection, communication, reliability, commitment, etc. are met, it won't matter who is initiating what. A secure relationship allows a person to stop keeping score of everything that happens because you generally feel safe, satisfied, and wanted.

That is unfortunate that your family isn't giving you the support you need. Sexual assaults are the lowest reported crimes because the victim is often ashamed or embarrassed. It is not your fault, people who sexually assault others are the scum of the earth. I was molested when I was a child and still get haunted from it even though it happened almost 10 years ago. It has affected me ever since it happened and will more than likely be that way forever. It isn't something that is easy to forget. My advice for you is to join support groups and talk about it, get your feelings out and try to become comfortable with them. I know talking about it brings up the memories, but it helps. I'd be willing to talk if you ever wanted to. Try to keep your head up.

U are a very brave and strong person who stood up and talked to your mom and brother about it. I have helped many people in past recovering from these kind of situations. If you need assistance feel free to get in touch. Remember better late than never. You have a long long life to go.

When I got into Berkeley, I was extremely excited and felt as though I deserved my admission based on my hard work in HS. However, when I actually got to Berkeley, I realized that the majority of my peers are WAAAAY smarter than me....but, who cares?? You got in, stick out your four years, and get UC Berkeley under your belt. I thought the admissions committee was on crack for accepting me after I finished my first semester, but I stuck it out. You obviously have something in you that makes you worthy of being a golden bear. Perseverance is all it takes.. (BTW, I had to look up how to spell "perseverance") :) You got this!

1) I'm not a genius in any way, shape, or form. 2) You must be a genius if you got accepted for Fall 2015! Those apps haven't even come out yet. Impressive, my friend. 3) All joking aside, excellent choice.

Get a hobby where you meet new, awesome people.

While this sentiment is nice, it's also important to realize that women are people too and not to put them on a pedestal

I don't like mornings either, and don't like busy shops, so I go to the supermarket at 2130-2230, and even though a busy supermarket, it empty.

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

I would say that it is entirely normal to have 'crushes' it's just just important to be aware that we cannot truly have any more than that as someone looking from a distance. Love can only really come from physical interaction and really knowing a person. Sure, we could obsess over them, but that isn't real because we don't actually know the person; they could be vile in reality, and if we base how we feel about them from the projections they make on social media or in the news, then we only get a filtered version of them, one that is unlikely to reveal any of the bad points about them. So, this would probably fall under 'idealisation' in that you see an ideal person, partly because that is all you're allowed to see and partly because that has become what you want to see. I am guessing that you follow them on social media and the like, so a start would be to break the habit of checking in on them, replacing this behaviour with something else more beneficial. Remind yourself that you don't know that person and that it would be far healthier to focus on 'real world' women and working towards meeting and getting to know someone in that way

I could be wrong but it sounds similar to OCD. I have something similar where I constantly say a sentance over and over in my head to the point where I feel I can't breath and I get really upset. It sounds like you are really suffering and I hope you can find a way to accept the songs so that they just play in the background.. not easy thought. My heart goes out to you x

im so sorry you were let down you can trust this forum though i promise please talk about your feelings here it is not good to bottle them up lots of love Lu xxxx

I'm sorry this has happened to you write. It is really hard to recover when you've trusted and opened up to therapists only to be let down in the end. I am in a similar situation with my psychologist. Took me ages to trust him, opened up to him about stuff I've never talked about to anyone else, cried myself through very difficult therapy, only for him to throw it all back in my face. He knows I have trust issues especially when it comes to men, because of my past, and he proved me right. I really don't know how you can move on from this, I'm hoping to meet up with an advocate after I've finished treatment to try and find a way forward. Not the same when the trust has gone though is it? I hope you can sort something out xxxx

Hi. As someone with a lot of anxiety, I completely get how crappy it feels to start a new job. Trying to learn the job duties along with gauging the personalities of all the new people you are working with can be overwhelming. Its possible that your participation was listed as optional, because they didn't want to make you feel pressured to attend a birthday lunch for/with people you don't know very well. At least that's what it sounds like to me. My company did a secret santa type thing in my department and gave me the option not to participate, due to only having been in this job for about four months or so (and I normally work night shifts so I don't have a ton of interaction with my coworkers). That's just my two cents on the situation, I hope it helps!

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

I am so sorry for what you and your family have experienced. I haven't had that type of experience, but I have suffered from PTSD. The more you talk about it, the better. But I would encourage you to speak with a counselor, someone who specializes in trauma. The rest of your life doesn't have to be lived in fear. I believe your story is miraculous. It sounds like God heard you. I believe if you ask Him to help you overcome the trauma, He'll hear you again and answer. I was led to speak to a counselor, and they helped tremendously. Then I continued to attend seminars to learn more about overcoming my past. It's a process, but God is faithful. I've experienced so much healing, and I don't doubt you will as well. Let us know how it goes. We're here with you.

This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

I feel okay. Like John Nash, I accept that my hallucinations are not real. They are not real people. So I can let them disappear in the distance. Do you think you could be projecting your feeings about breaking up with the child's mom onto the boy ?? Transferring your feelings onto a 7 month old baby is truly bad for the child. This is your son and he looks up to you. He is the wellspring of love. Let that love infect your being.  Adjusting to the idea that you are a parent for life, that is a big adjustment. No wonder you can't eat or sleep, this was a surprise for you, not a planned event.

You have been in this position a long time and it will feel shocking to you to be assertive with her. She is being very selfish. Your school work is work enough. When she is verbally abusive to you, you are old enough now to stop pleasing her and tell her instead that you do not deserve to be treated that way. And walk out of the house after you tell her that you do not deserve to be treated that way. Do not do the chores if she verbally abuses you. If you treat me that way, I won't help you at all. You can stand up to her. You are not her little girl anymore. Doing this will feel foreign to you. But she is being very bossy and unkind to a perfect daughter. I tried to get my mother's understanding and approval for years before I realized I wasn't going to get it.

You are a young adult and need your own space, especially with going to med school. You might need to sit down with mom and have a heart to heart talk with her. Explain how difficult med school is and the amount of work required to be successful. She might also need to come to realize that all work and no play is a formula for failure. Remember it is her house and she is doubling as a landlord. It is a difficult situation for both of you.Perhaps you can agree on some things you can do around the house that would be acceptable to both of you. Be firm , loving and prepared when you approach her. Be sure to choose a good time for both of you where you are both relaxed and open to the conversation.

I am so sorry. It must have been devastating for you. So heart breaking. Thinking of you. xxxx I just hope your post here makes at least one person think twice before acting and can save a life.

My brother killed himself a few years ago. I don't keep track of the date. But losing a child is a whole nother level of heartbreak. I know I was devastated when my GF lost our baby at 3 months. But having actually having had known him and loving him for so many years then losing him cannot be easy. Just try and remember the good times you shared.

Hi, you seem to enjoy things like computers and board games. Do you see this as a good thing or a bad thing? I think it is good to spend your free time doing what you enjoy. Even if other people think it's weird. Maybe you can meet people while you play board games at cafes and other public places. If they enjoy it you can talk to them about it. I think people need relationships in order to feel good. Good luck, don't give up.

I'm sorry you've been struggling, I would advise that you go to your GP as soon as possible. If the racing thoughts get too much go to A/E or contact out of hours or 111 if your in the UK. Many mental health conditions have racing thoughts. Are you sleeping? I agree the headache could be from tension/stress. Have you tried any paracetamol did it help? Hope you feel better very soon. Take care

When I had severe headaches, I fixed it by an improved diet, eating less sugar, and drinking more water, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine. A magnesium deficiency can be related to hallucinations and insomnia.

That's beside the point, I need to be here for a number of reasons. I'm just curious about the behaviour

Many mental health conditions have racing thoughts. Are you sleeping? I agree the headache could be from tension/stress. Have you tried any paracetamol did it help? Hope you feel better very soon. Take care

When I had severe headaches, I fixed it by an improved diet, eating less sugar, and drinking more water, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine. A magnesium deficiency can be related to hallucinations and insomnia.

That's beside the point, I need to be here for a number of reasons. I'm just curious about the behaviour

I don't honestly know much about masochism nor how it relates to self harming, or develops from self harming. I know that when a tendency in me arose towards bulimia behavior, I said to myself, "Oh hell no, not another fucking craziness. I have enough craziness with the bipolar. I'm NOT doing bulimia too. No way." And I stopped doing it. So if there isn't a childhood trauma to identify (how could you have PTSD without a trauma ??) it boils down to: Do you want to keep this urge as your little secret or Do you want to nip it in the bud ??

Not sure what to say here too. But I was bullied a lot too. Some stupid guys used to touch my butt- I was that fat girl who had no bf. It was so embarrassing... First step, is to tell someone about it. Talking about it is a huge relief. Since he has other victims, please, you need to tell someone who can do something-like the police. Have you tried therapy? It's a good way to forget about deep fears - 3 years ago a teacher told me to commit suicide, that I wasn't worth it. That made me deeply depressed, more than I was already, and I associate school with bad things, that's why I'm homeschooled, I just couldn't keep going. I've been to therapy. There is improvement, but you just don't forget about something so bad like that. But it helps!If you want, message me. I'm a good listener!

hi ,i will be your friend. im 38 soon and i would love to try and support you. i have BPD ,social phobia ,anxiety ,depression and dependent PD. i know it would only be online but im here if you want me. love Lu xx

I hope we're already friends, I'm here for support whenever you need me. Take care

I have followed you for years and wished to be a friend. I found out you were too guarded. I was going to send a Christmas card but you did not trust me with your address. I know your last friend was the priest and his wife. But it is ok to move on. I hope you finally find someone whom you are comfortable with. It would surely help.

I too have a irrational fear of people i love dying on me even though there is no relevant evidence to suggest i should be worrying. I have found that getting therapy has helped me a lot, helped me to challenge my negative thoughts. Obviously one day there is going to be a need to be worried but right now if i find myself thinking about this thought i tap myself and say no. This brings me back into the present and away from chasing that thought. Have you thought about going to see your doctor and asking for an assessment? Talking really does help, here to listen if you want to talk. Hugs

You don't sound like a narcissist to me. You just sound extremely depressed. Usually we think of depression as a feeling of sadness - but it isn't necessarily. When I am very depressed, I simply become numb and emotionless except for a cold, analytical self-hatred. Hold onto the reasons that you have for not committing suicide. Remember that it is a very final solution, and mental illness can be treated though it is often a long, rocky road. Have you ever seen a psychiatrist? You may have to try different medications for your depression (and bipolar?) Not every medication works for everyone, and you have to find the combination that's right for you. I feel that would be the first step, and from there you may be able to see a therapist and work your way through this. Don't give up, you are a worthwhile person!

I’m so sorry for what you’re experiencing right now. I want to encourage you to seek help and support from your family and friends or consider to join a support group where you can meet face to face. It will help you not to feel isolated and alone. Consult with your doctor regularly, if you think your medications are not working, you can ask for a new prescription. Take good care of yourself, eat healthy diet, have enough sleep and regular exercise. Please don’t try to harm yourself. Don’t give up, you will get better. I will be praying for you.

I've been there many times. The feeling of numbness and guilt are overwhelming. Trust me, we are all narcissistic and it is ok to be so a little bit. I suggest exploring your emotions a bit and not hiding or being afraid of them. I'm glad you are afraid of dying since that is a clear sign that part of your mind still is convincing you to not commit suicide. It seems like you care for your parents but you don't realize the complexity of the emotion. You don't want them to be sad and it is kind of clear that you don't want to bother them. Take some time to reflect and see yourself without labels such as good, bad, parasite, etc. Parents are suppose to be a support and as long as they are willing to do so, let them do it. This inquietude that you feel is a clear sign that you are still tuning your ambitions. Keep looking for things that you love to do.

I've had racing thoughts or feelings before although they are very rare for me. It's weird feeling, like my brain is switching around at high speed.

I don't think this is psychosis. Don't let people give simple diagnosis like that. What you went through is closer to ADHD than anything else. During the day, we go through many emotions and thoughts. It is not clear many times how our brain must order our thoughts, so when they are racing through, chances are that it will be difficult to calm down and explore each one by one. I know that many people take this in the wrong way but have you tried or thought about meditating? It's been helping me a lot since I was a teenager.

Try to meditate and take deep long breaths in moments like this. Let the racing thoughts come and go, they will eventually decelerate.

I’m not entirely unfamiliar with these things You need to get back in touch with your gentle side, the part of yourself that hosts emotions of loving-kindness, empathic joy, compassion, generosity and so on. This can be done through meditation, for me a big breakthrough was to look at our shared suffering and the fact that everybody suffers in different ways. No matter how joyful people look, underneath the surface there is pain and suffering that they are resolutely not looking at, and this can open the doors to your feelings of compassion. Other routes you could look into would be for instance a family constellation group, often these things are connected to what happened to you during childhood. Psychotherapists often offer this therapy type to help people get more in touch with the way they have experienced their parents, siblings and so on. About your anger, I’d be extra careful not to let the easy experience of anger start to dominate your emotional life, it will only make things more difficult for you in the long term.

I can kinda understand what u describe. Growing up I always seemed to have a 'strange' sense of humour. for example Id see a film where someone is getting killed by being run over by a car and lose their legs and find it funny while others found it grotesque. One of the best ones I heard was 'I knew XXX was gay cos hes always so 'nice''. Or 'I hate how all the lads tease XXX just because hes so perfect'. Im far from perfect. Theres nothing wrong with being selfish... just dont hurt others in the process

The feeling of numbness is normal. Not having emotions or feeling like you are faking it through is mostly a manifest of the fact that you are aware of your thoughts. I've been there when I felt like I had no clear direction but the one given by my parents.

Hiya and to the forum. I think your mother has suffered so much that she has learned to put on a hard shell and not feel empathy in case it was dangerous for her. She is totally wrong in her assessment of everything and you are not being stupid AT ALL. You have genuine feelings of pain and need support. I think that sometimes a person who has been through hell themselves (your mother) can't see that their response to that pain affects their children. She has caused you untold damage by her reaction and she won't be able to see it. You don't have a perfect life, you are like the rest of us, have ups and downs and not perfection. i don't think you will be able to get your mother to see sense on this. She sounds as though she has closed her mind. I think you need to get help for yourself first and not minimise your feelings. Some therapy or seeing a doctor might help you. I would first tell you that you are entitled to your feelings and you are in need as much as anyone else on here. Your feelings are valid.

A lot of people don't seem to be able to understand depression. The pain a clinically depressed person can be the same as a person that has had X happen to them. The thing is we can't control it, we are brave strong people that face those feelings every day without giving up. Your mom was so wrong to say those things to you. Facebook always gets me down because people don't respond to my posts. I hope things with your mom work out the way you want them to.

I'm very sorry for your losses xx. Must be very raw for you. I would suggest do try out getting some support, don't give up if the first person you see isn't right, but try again. And then see how you feel in say 6-12 months time? You are understandably full of grief at the moment. It must be hard to see forward at all. But perhaps having time to talk to someone objective could help you to evaluate things better. I can very much relate to feeling entirely hopeless and not wanting to live at all. I hope things can get better for you. xx

Today must have been hugely difficult, especially with the conflict of feelings about the funerals. No wonder you are feeling so low. I'm the odd one out amongst my family. I don't have a partner or friends or a job and can't see any point being here. It doesn't matter. What matters is making sure that you are getting enough support to enable you to think rationally away from huge triggers and stresses like today, and decide on a way forwards in time that is doable for you. If you need more time off work you could discuss this with your GP/employer if that would help...x I wish you well xx

I’m sorry you are feeling like you are worthless and I know – I’ve been there. The reality is you are worth so very much and I hope you can begin to see this. You are uniquely gifted and you have a story to tell and a part to play in your own life and in others’. Many people in your position are not sensitive to how their problems affect others. You care about your husband’s reactions to your situation and that is a hopeful sign – you have not withdrawn into yourself. You are aware of how you feel; ask yourself how this is impacting your behavior, and also what you are doing to change your situation. You need action here. Have you talked to your family doctor? You have a psychiatrist – do you consider them an effective help? If not, try someone else but keep persevering. Have you tried simply a counselor? If you’re on medication, do you stay on track with it? These are all positive things you can do to help yourself. Once you feel you’re moving forward, talk this over with your husband. He loves you and I’m sure is concerned and would be encouraged.

Hi and welcome to the forum! Dont worry about posting here, thats what the forum is for, to vent, to express how you feel, to try and make sense of whats going on. There are people out there that are going to read this and who are going to care so please stick with it and wait to hear what others advise. Hugs

I read every word. First off, there is no problem in this world that can't be made worse by drinking or other substance abuse. You must address that first. There are tons of help available and I know of a wonderful forum for sobriety that if you pm me, I will send that to you. Second, stop and think for a minute about your willingness to take illegitimate substances but stubbornly refuse a prescription which can authentically help you. It's true it may take a few weeks to kick in, but if you don't give it a start will you not be in the same or worse circumstances at the end of those few weeks? Bravo for leaving the terribly abusive Ex, that is horrid business and takes a lot of time and work to heal from. I have, to my dismay, been down that path. It is so confusing at the time. So damaging. Just about everywhere has free domestic violence counseling. Please give them a call asap. You are in dire trouble on several fronts and I am so glad you are reaching out for help and support. I hope you will make some positive decisions and pivotal changes in your life. There is a huge support community to help you through all it.

We are here to listen, and yes I read your entire entry. Please don't think that no one cares because we do! I really feel bad for you because it sounds like you are in a very manipulative relationship and your friendships are not that great either. You are going to people, drugs, sex to numb the pain that you have, but none of that will eventually solve any of your problems. Actually, all of them will make them worse. What you need is some stable, solid people in your lives that truly care about you. Do you have family or friends that truly care, rather than taking advantage of you? if so, stick to those people and slowly put your life back together. if not, have you considered visiting a church or join a group and form some solid friendships?

Shame your cctv doesn't work, I have motion sensors on mine, so they aren't recording all the time. No point them recording nothing! Keep a camera handy, and record dates and times. Problem is of course, from a flying drone you can't prove who's flying it for police purposes. But gettting evidence is a start. This will become a big problem in future, let me tell you.

This may not be a wise move from a legal standpoint, but I would knock it out of the air. You'd surely know who was flying it when they came to collect the wreckage. But then that might instigate a fight. I HATE drones. I read about a guy who shot one down with a shotgun because the neighbor was using it to take pictures of his young daughters in bathing suits near their pool. My brother told me about a nature show he was watching, they had a drone getting close up photos of a chimpanzee or other ape. The ape getting pissed off at it casually picked up a stick and knocked it out of the air smashing it to pieces. I feel the same way about drones as the ape did.

I think it's like everything. New or old. The majority of people use things ok. I have a drone, not flown it yet. but a small percentage ruin it for everyone. If you look up laws, almost every one is because of morons. It's not too dissimilar to locking doors. I hate locking doors, in fact I think I wrote a 20 page chapter on locking doors!

Having an episode of "going fast" turn into depression is so shocking. I have the bipolar and what has happened to you sounds familiar to me. I'm always telling people to analyze their childhood and make sure their depression isn't coming from the past. But sometimes, I think the body just goes into these cycles. I just went through a period of mania/insomnia for five days myself. I am on medication; lithium 450mg and navane 2mg. I did better on 600mg lithium but it made my intestines very sick after 7 years, so we cut it down. It's frustrating for you to have to put your life/plans on HOLD because of this MH interference. I can tell you it usually doesn't last forever because the body chemistry changes. You will get better, but nobody knows WHEN.

Your "fast" episode sounds a lot like classic mania. Everything is driven, sped up, bouncing wildly from one thing to another. Brilliant ideas that you realize later didn't even make sense. Not sleeping. With my Bipolar II diagnosis I don't experience mania quite to the extreme that you're describing - no psychosis etc., only on the lows - and it's called "hypomania." But even with that, I'm all too familiar with that sickening crash. It seems like at a certain point in a manic episode, your mind and body just plain run out of energy. No one can sustain that accelerated pace forever. For me actually it has never lasted longer than two weeks. And then you find yourself teetering on the edge. The smallest thing can trigger it, and before you know it, so rapidly that someone watching you could probably see it happen - you fall out of the sky. I have just recently pulled out of a very long and deep depressive episode that was triggered by my diagnosis and exacerbated by the mood stabilizer they put me on. The dosage, as it turns out, was too high; not only was it knocking off the highs, but it was flattening my mood at a level far below where it should have been. A simple change in dose of the same mood stabilizer, plus a different antidepressant, and I truly feel like a new person. Sadly, like your team told you, it just does take time. Different people respond in different ways to various medications and therapies, and it takes time just to see if a medication is working before trying something else. Most antidepressants, for example, won't take effect until about a month after starting them. In dealing with the fallout from your manic episode, knowledge is power. You can't change what you did, but you can learn and understand why you did it - why your mind was out of control. Strained and broken relationships are the most painful thing, and sometimes they never can be repaired. But as I'm learning, it's so important that you forgive yourself and move on from there. To keep wallowing in mortified guilt isn't going to get you anywhere. It just makes your offense look bigger and bigger in hindsight. Anyway I'm wishing you the best in all this. It's a tough road for sure, and things may get worse before they get better (I hope not!) but they will get better.

Are you sure about that though? I've felt it myself, and I actually took a video of myself on it and jeez was I out of it, I didn't particularly feel it though, but I did feel more 'chatty'. I also worked with someone before that came into work on Diazepam (again for a physical injury) and she was basically on a trip. She didn't realize she was so out of it, but she was, to the point where she ended up getting taken home by one of the managers! It's a powerful drug that masks things very well, hence why I don't agree with its usage in this sense.

i feel so sad you want to become a robot ,so to speak. i have BPD to am full of intense emotions ,although i find it difficult i wouldn't want to be without emotions at all because they are part of who i am do you receive any counselling at the moment? i think that would really help you

you are not alone solitude every time i see cruelty i wish i could be less emotional ie burst into tear you would think with a mother like i had i would have had a thicker skin but alas no our emotions hurt as my voices tell me i am to have a balance and i like you are always analysing how are we to make sense of the world otherwise but not a robot - to look and see but not know

I can relate. When my ex wife left me abruptly and without warning I spiralled out of control and turned to the bottle for comfort. I drank copious amounts of alcohol and took lots of street drugs. That's no place you want to be believe me. Its natural to want to feel nothing. But I think you could work thru some of these things in therapy. Its clichè but time does heal all wounds. Keep posting here though. Its good to get it out. Take care.

For me, i remember once a family member having a go at me about my room and because i already had mental health problems as well as attempts on my life, this incident again brought up strong emotions and thoughts about running away and perhaps suicide. But in the end i decided to leave it be and then the next day i was glad that i didn't act on anything. This was important because it showed me that i don't need or have to listen to my emotions, thoughts, etc. I can wait and see it out. I can use that as a tool for if it ever happens again. Please don't listen to those feelings and thoughts, they are completely wrong. Once you see it out, i hope this also allows you to see that you shouldn't act on these things and that there is light.

I think it's a good thing to come here whenever you want to. This isn't the best place for advice compared to GPs, but it's much better for emotional support. I think that it's important to know that this is a long rollercoaster, with lots of ups and downs. Keep going, as it's a marathon, not a sprint. Have you seen a GP?x

Sorry you are feeling so bad. I just try and get through each hour, each minute. Breaking down time rather than seeing it as endless. Sometimes I stay in bed so I can't act on the thoughts. Distract. With regard to therapy, it can make you feel worse before you feel better because of bringing things to the surface that may have been buried in your head for a long time. Talking can be very painful but hopefully if you can get through it things will get better

You've done the right thing. It will be confidential. There will be an investigation. Don't doubt yourself, they will decide what the next steps are for the well being of the child, that isn't your responsibility. Imagine if no one had said anything and something had happened to the little boy? Hope you can look after yourself xx

the thing with neighbor problems especially if there are lots of other neighbors close by, they really cant be sure. i mean the folk opposite could have complained. i have been in a situation where i complained about a neighbour who was a hazard to themselves and others. and the person did actually say to me it was you wasnt it and i denied it. as i had nothing to loose and they would never be sure. like you i couldnt cope with the situation and needed to bring it to an end as no one else who lived in the neighborhood was going to do it. and really they need to be careful as if they are doing drugs they need to keep a fairly low profile and any possibilty of keeping their little boy is at stake. so the odds are stacked against them. maybe might be a good idea to report them for drug use to the police while you are about it. as then the police can keep an eye on it. and maybe take action in the future again you can remain anonymous

You have absolutely done the right thing here. There should be more people like you in the world. Please don't beat yourself up about it. I think that I would have done the same as you. x

Mental illness has no prejudice and can affect anyone. It's just that an illness. I attempted suicide 2 years ago, and thankfully regretted it and called 911 to save myself. I still have thoughts of suicide, but last month my step father committed suicide and after dealing with the loss, unanswered questions and witnessing what this has done to my mother I just can not ever do it no matter what thoughts I have. When I attempted one of my daughters was home and since my step dad did it all I can think of is how I made my daughter feel that day, and when the thoughts come instantly I see her face and I am so thankful. You are not lame for writing on this forum, you are brave and a lot stronger than you think. It doesn't seem like your meds are working. Maybe tell your doc that you don't think they are working, your having irrational thoughts, or something like that. I know you don't want to probably say suicidal thoughts because then they will put you in the hospital, so just think of a clever way to say that. Also, are you anxiety, depression, bipolar?

I'm sorry you're feeling so terrible Imhotep That's such a hard place to be, when you're having suicidal thoughts, and everything seems hopeless. It's not lame at all to write about this here. Many people will relate to the place you find yourself in, many of us have been there too. I hope expressing here how you feel, and reaching out to others who might understand, will help a little. I'm glad you've posted what you did, it's better than keeping it to yourself, and struggling alone. If you feel in danger of acting on your suicidal thoughts please have a look at our page on getting help. It tells you who to contact if you need emergency medical help, plus other sources of support if you feel in crisis. There is also this article by one of our staff members on feeling suicidal that may be helpful to read. I hope things improve for you Imhotep. Do you have any support at the moment, anyone you can talk to? Please don't feel you have failed, you are at a really difficult time in your life, but that doesn't mean you are a failure. Try not to compare yourself to others, in my experience it has only made me feel worse about myself. And it's not comparing like with like. You are trying (and have tried hard in the past with different approaches) to find a way out, a way for things to feel better. I know it's hard, but please keep trying. Something will help, if you can find the right thing for you. I hope your anxiety lessens enough to let you get some sleep. Take care.

You definitely are NOT lame for writing on this forum. You are asking for help and therefore are alot stronger than you believe. Have you spoken to your doctor about the meds not working? Perhaps this would be a good idea to do so. Also, it couldn't hurt to explain to him, in person verbally...or on paper if it is easier for of the negative thoughts you are having. If you do not think he is listening to you, there are other doctors.

I would complain to the Council. For your own mental health. What she is doing totally disrespects her neighbors. Don't worry about protecting her. You may be doing her a favor. Bad behavior does not deserve to be rewarded.

Wow, that's rough. I'm sorry. I've had difficult neighbors as well. I know that you are afraid to talk to her about the yelling, but have you tried coming to her as a friend and asking if she's okay? Maybe if you approached the situation from a position of wanting to help her, she'd be more willing to listen. She, probably, feels alone and afraid--especially if she has some kind of mental disorder. Most of the time, people just need someone to listen. I bet she does. Kindness disarms people.

If she knows that you also have mental health difficulties it would certainly be worth a shot approaching her about it, explaining that what she's doing is effecting you in a detrimental way, but also drawing attention to what she's actually doing, as she may not realise that it is so 'bad'.

My Gran has Alzheimer's and she has been in an over 65s psychiatric hospital but in the next few weeks she's moving to a nursing home (one we chose after much searching). It is quite distressing because it is like you're losing that person and suffering grief even though they are alive, because they are not the strong personality they once were.

Have you read my intro in the front page? I only mention it as you can look out for the Home doing good care for your gran. It is sad to be the relative of someone living with dementia, but in knowing a little of what you can do and better understand, can be helpful, I hope.

I cared for my grandmother for a number of years till she passed, but I always promised her that she wouldn't be sent away, as she was terrified of hospital and....my mother (her daughter). I took on her care, after I found that my mother had taken my nans dog to be put down as she (my mother) didn't like cleaning up after it.... not that my mother saw her much. My Nan cared for me as a child and was the buffer between me and my mother (along with my granddad). She was a lovely woman, who towards the end, constantly asked what day it was, tipped her plate of food down the back of the kitchen radiator, and insisted that my father had stolen my grandfathers work tools. Never aggressive, often bewildered, but always grateful if you sat and held her hand. I miss her also

I would think that hyperventilation would be associated at most times with anxiety but I could be wrong. I breathe very shallow most of the time so I don't have your experience. The one who knows best what you are feeling is you. If you are having the hyperventilation but no anxiety, are you thinking the anxiety is hidden under the breathing ??

I am thinking that anxiety can be related to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress and anxiety We can have chronic metabolic acidosis, which includes anxiety due to hypoxia as one of its symptoms. Increased breathing compensates for the acidity by decreasing carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Panic attacks may indicate a problem with pH, which is compensated for by hyperventilation. Over compensation can result in alkalosis. I think this can be caused by a chronic poor diet, such as a typical western diet. Eating nutrient rich foods helped me lose my anxiety, as well as avoiding caffeine, sugar, sodas. Antioxidants, such as lemon juice, may be helping also. A Magnesium deficiency can also related to anxiety (and depression, insomnia), and I am trying to keep topped up with epsom salt baths. What you are describing sounds quite like Kussmaul breathing a symptom of severe metabolic acidosis.

I do have anxiety and it is pretty severe. What is confusing me is that they say anxiety attacks bring about hyperventilation and many other symptoms I show and I rarely get those attacks, I avoid most situations. This is how I can explain the confusion at my best. There are those times when people have panic attacks and they show signs like hyperventilation. I do have anxiety and I always experience hyperventilation, not only at the time of a panic attack. Is hyperventilation bound to those times one experiences panic attacks?

These must make life very difficult. Some kind of therapy may be helpful. Have you consulted anyone about these issues

Can someone suggest a solution. I suffer from physicos because past flat share mates kept on coming in my private dwelling while I was sleeping moving things around, stealing items, vandalising fixture and fittings, even hacked into the wi fi. The offenses have been petty and vile to the point, I hate being around strangers, odd surroundings,. Do you think I ll get better or is this how things are going to remain.

Using your body during the day will help you be tired and ready to sleep at night,walking or sports,swimming going to the gym.Don't watch telly too late,have your bedroom warm and airy,drink some hot drink before bed,read a little before you try to sleep.Nytol and other over the counter remedies may help they are better than drugs off the doctor.Getting your anxiety levels down try to switch off the worry at bedtime,don't think about things, empty your mind,you can try mindfulness practise and deep breathing exercises.Google it, deep breathing to aid sleep.Good luck with this.

I have similar issues with insomnia. It was actually caused by me taking a sedative for to long. I haven't found anything to be successful. I sleep about as well on the antipsychotic/sedative that I am as I did before. The difference is that I know can't sleep with out it.

It's very serious, yes. But It's possible to resolve the problem. Health emotional surrounding, physical exercises and meditation should do the treatment. But the trick is you should be persistent and do it every single day. Another effective way is hypnosis. There're audio podcasts on the web. Ny favorite is this one Sleep Hypnopill - Best Self Hypnosis Audio for Insomnia, Deep Sleep Hypnotherapy

You don't trust him. That's not a good early sign for sure. Here's my two cents: Coming from someone who's been married and separated in that marriage, the best advice I've ever gotten is to never make any major decision regarding your relationship really fast or out of an emotional place. If you were already married, I'd say take sixmonths to a year before deciding to leave or stay. You are engaged, still a major commitment but with less weight. Maybe we'll say 3 months. Why? Because we tend to make the wisest decisions when we have time to think and let our emotions settle. You love him but don't trust him. You will need time to communicate and work on that in order to decide whether a marriage will work or not. If you need to postpone the wedding, by all means, postpone it. That may be a good time to tie in the conversation you'll have with him about trust. Avoid accusing him and use I statements." I'm struggling to trust you here. I'm reevaluating our relationship but I'd like to make it work,." Etc Whatever you do, do not just freak out and leave and call it off in one day. Do not make a decision out of hurt and being upset because you won't be truly ready to move on. It is good to stay with the one you love--- if after a time of careful consideration, you are confident you can be a team and face struggles together. Also, sex does not keep a marriage. If he loves you, he will be faithful. If he's unfaithful and loving it, no amount of sex can make him true to you. That being said, consider if there's something he's not getting from you that can be easily adjusted. Something like the level of respect you treat him with. A lot of men thrive off our respect in a relationship. Ive said a lot. Hope things work out.

I'm sorry that this is such a difficult situation. Have you considered a seeing a relationship counselor? Even if your fiancé won't go, it will be helpful to discern which direction you should take with your relationship. You deserve to have peace of mind.

I've been married for 16 years. I can tell you it doesn't get easier. Having kids makes it harder. Divorce hurts kids. I'd advise being sure everything is healthy before you tie the knot. I watch porn a lot as a coping mechanism and I hide it from my wife. Sex with her is good. Even if we're having sex regularly I still watch it. It hurts her when she finds it but I rely on it to self sooth. I know it's not healthy and I know I should build real relationships.

It's difficult when it comes from family isn't IT the people who are supposed to love us. I've learned to stop looking for what I need/ needed from theese people. It's not you Its them.

Your story is not unusual. A lot of people who post complain about dis-interested and toxic family members. My experience is similar. A lot of people are just brainwashed and don't think. You need to think independently to break through the mainstream thought process. It is a step too far for some people who are just on autopilot. A lot are obsessed with money or power, or just their own little bubble. In reality, few people really care or understand. Work towards your strengths, keep grounded and lucid, and treat your toxic family with caution and contempt.

Wondering if any of your family members have had any trauma in the past. My step dad beat my mom when we were kids (he was also abused and is a combat vet). All us kids are dealing with how we processed this and other traumas to this day, yet if you ask her she will say "that was in the past" and doesn't understand why my brother doesn't come around.

1) It's absolutely perfectly ok and normal to not be sure at times or even most or all the time. 2) Yes it's normal to be honest and say you are not sure but also it's best to say you are not sure if you really are not sure. Imagine this situation: An athlete call Bob hasn't had much training and has been eating junk food, and his trainer asks if he wants to participate in an up coming race. Bob now has two choices, be honest with his trainer or lie and say he is ready. So what you did it's correct. It's always best to be honest. 3) Yea i would say it;s normal to disagree with your family/siblings/parents about principals, philosophies, in regards to life. I'm different to both my parents in my life view and principals. Some people are similar to their parents, but others are not. 4) Just know that you have not done anything wrong and that you should be proud that you have a great quality in being honest. You know yourself best. And hopefully then you can put this behind you. And also know that you can always ask on this forum for an opinion or to vent about life. We are not judgemental here and we will always support one another.

I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one

I have found that my parents will say things thinking that they are being helpful but they have no idea how their words aren't helping. I think this is mostly because they are looking at the situation through their own experiences. I still confide in them sometimes but I don't take them very seriously. The only person who has helped me figure things out is my therapist.

It's often because the parents are powerful and schools don't want to run the risk of making such powerful enemies. That only fuels their power rush though as they think they're invincible. On the other side of the spectrum though and much like what you said about how they need counselling, if they're having problems at home that are causing this bullying nature the school doesn't want to get involved.

I agree that the victim shouldn't have to move to get away from bullying. That should be a last resort if all over measures have failed.

You may already have done so but I think is a good idea to get any symptoms checked out to ensure there is nothing physical behind them. Therapy such as cbt can sometimes help to cope with symptoms of health anxiety.

Glad you have had it checked out. Hope you get the cbt again soon xxx

I completely understand how you feel. i have such bad health anxiety that any little ache or twinge sets me off. i agree get yourself checked out for ease of mind more than anything. The only problem i have atm is sometimes i find it extremely difficult to come away from these physical symptoms such as i get currently severe shakes to the point my body wont relax. It makes me stress out more. i wish you all the best in your battle. take every day as it is. Things will get better.

Germaphobia is a tough mental issue to overcome but you have been given this task or developed this problem and you definitely have taken the right first step opening up and talking about it here on this forum. I have a friend in the hospital with cancer and he also has an open sore on his leg. They said it might be Mrsa and bandaged it. I was freaking out that they let me just go in his hospital room without gloves and precautions. They never told me and I just went in there to visit. I was upset for quite awhile but had to let it go. It's hard to let it go.

I use to take neurontin and it not only made my hair fall out in clumps, it turned my very curly hair into straight hair. Now I'm having blurry vision from lithium. Before this I had severe GI distress from the lithium, so we cut the dosage down quite a bit. All the drugs have side effects. It's like I have a bad marriage to psychiatry; until death do us part.

Ablify is at least one I know of that makes hair fall out. It made my hair fall out in clumps and bits and no one believed me. It was horrible. So, yeah some medications can cause hair loss. Talk to your doctor about it. If it is the medication it will grow back after stopping it.

I have been suffering from hair loss for like 6 months as I had bariatric surgery. I lost like half of my hair, but today my boss told me of injections of B12 that helped her with the hair loss. Maybe it's something you could ask about your doctor?

I'm so very sorry for all that your going thru. Sorry for your loss, glad your receiving treatment and having therapy. The bullying will have damaged your self confidence, please don't be sorry and don't blame yourself. You really should report, I can understand your fears. Can you find another job? You shouldn't have too however you will probably be happier. Here to listen. Take care

Here a couple of things I'd say to offer some support (although I am by no means a licensed professional): 1. Structure - You noted to us that whenever you're alone, your anxiety and depression get the best of you. I'm the same way (minus the depression), because my OCD makes me obsess a lot over little things. In general, I would recommend structure. Get out more often, find things to fill your time with—that are healthy—and do your best to lead a productive life. 2. Finding a Job - Finding a job sounds like it will be essential to your recovery path. What I would recommend is asking your clinical supports (e.g counselor) if there are any rehab programs that help mentally ill people find employment. In my state of Massachusetts, we have an organization called MRC that does just that. My hope is that those options will be made available to you. However, I would also say to take it easy. While money is a present problem for you, putting too much pressure on yourself over finding a job while you're already on a bumpy road will exacerbate your symptoms. You want to ensure you're stable going into a job. 3. Coping Skills - Coping skills are also imperative to your overall mental health. Everyone needs them. When you have moments of self-doubt, ask yourself some questions: "What makes this not my fault?" "What can I do to help myself?" Something else that will help is giving yourself self-soothing. Coloring, writing, drawing, listening to music, meditation, and exercise are all healthy examples of coping mechanisms that are recommended by clinical professionals. They keep us feeling strong and help us keep our minds in the right place. 4. Give Yourself a Break - You're not to blame for everything. It really is unfortunate that you've lost so many people, and I'm very sorry that all of these difficulties are piling up on your shoulders, but there is a lot of hope still in store for you. You have to be easy on yourself, and recognize that we're only human. Pace your recovery and make sure your counselor is aware of how you feel. If you need any further encouragement or support, let me know!

I would just like to thank you all for the very thoughtful comments already received. It truly means the world to me. Keeping everything to myself for so long and finally releasing it all on here, then to receive such heartwarming replies in such a short space of time has blown my mind. Excellent advice too which I will definitely follow. For the first time in months and months I feel like I am not alone.

It's so old school to say stressful situations are character building. A Little Support would be character building. There will be more of this character building if you go into the forces.

Depending on how much longer you have, If you are stuck in the situation and need to finish school, I would stick with it until it is done and move on. If it is a longer term situation, I would find whoever is in charge (not the immediate supervisor that you have talked to but the one who is above) and explain the situation. You should not have to be forced into gossiping and talking about things that has nothing to do with work, that is abuse, and you should not have to participate in that. So if it is short term, bear with it for a few months. but any longer talk to the one above your supervisor. If it gets to the point where you have to seek medical attention to your anxiety , that is way too much.

I’d also look into why exactly this is causing you stress... being asked to sit with workmates, teambuilding lunches, it doesn’t sound like it should be causing stress. Similarly it’s kind of normal to be open to a certain extent when with others. So if this is causing you stress, perhaps there is some other underlying cause? What Poopy Doll said about the forces is also probably right, that the kind of attitudes towards “building character” there are even more old school then at other institutions. It’s worth thinking about what you are letting yourself in for...

No not really being suicidal isn't part of psychosis.Psychosis means you have lost touch with reality in some way,in that you might not know you are on earth or alive or conscious of your surroundings,you may be delusional and living a different reality...like you may think you are on a different planet and everyone around you are aliens in human form,you might not know what day or time it is and may take off and live rough for days until help finds you.Psychotic depression can include very low mood and suicidal feelings though but it isn't usually a major factor in psychosis.Does that help and make sense?

That does make more sense. But can a person be in such a low mood they kind of lose touch perhaps not with reality but with themselves??

ok best i can advise is i suffer from Psychosis and major depression at a very low time can have the same affects in some cases if you so low yes u can totaly lose reality and become a prisoner with in yourself but also this can happen but you seem to carry on as normal with day to day life but this major depressive feeling is deep with in yourself which is a worry as everybody around u sees u as normal this mental injury doesent have plasters or a bandage to show you are ill or hurt ive suffered so long i mask it well my family cant tell my state of mind 80% of the time which is bad you need to open up as much as possible and try not to totaly hide it so this way you dont become a prisoner with in your own mind/body i have a 5yr post on this site all the good and bad and still running today may be worth a read i hope u manage to fine the piece with in yourself and find your way to cope with this all the best mark

Opening up is hard. I hate feeling weak. That's how I feel about my life too. No job, no school, no friends, no drivers license, can't even exercise anymore besides painful short walks. It really licks! Do you have any passions or hobbies you might do?

I am no expert, but I often think most people are pretending a lot of the time. If you look on Facebook, most people will post photos of themselves eating in restaurants, on holiday, smiling, but in reality their life isn't like that everyday. They don't mention the negative things in their life. If you went around taking photos of everyone going about their day to day business, I bet most people would not be smiling. I feel like if I am not ok, I have to pretend I am ok. Even when I am extremely stressed and upset, people don't notice (except for very close family members).

I tend to focus inwards: Imagine better times. Make plans. Do something I enjoy. Visit some one I like. Basically I look after myself. Your relationship with your self is the most important you'll ever have.

You are still quite young and have time on your side. You have time to have experiences that will change you. You have time to challenge your Core Beliefs. You can identify your Core Beliefs and learn to let them go. One such belief might be, "I am a bad person" or "No one can love me" or "I am a failure and disappointment". I had the core belief that "I do not deserve to BE" and spent years getting rid of this notion. These are just ideas we are carrying around with us. They are not FACTS.

Loneliness, sadness, anger come from your post? Maybe pushing out feelings that are hard to manage and focusing them on other people? Don't know, sorry. Is Ok to feel these things to an extent but obviously they are causing you problems otherwise you wouldn't be here? x

Anger is one of those emotions that usually manifests first or last when under distress, certainly from experience. Anger leads to jealousy. Jealousy leads to hatred. Hatred leads to loneliness. If you can best your anger life will become easier, I do not mean that anger should be completely abolished, some of the emotions that you displayed in this post were reasonable, which doesn't make you a bad person does it?

I’m so sorry to hear you are experiencing all of this, it sounds like an awful lot to have to cope with. Having your friends walk away and try to ignore you by putting their headphones in must be a very difficult thing to have happen, especially at a time when you need support. I think you have been very strong and brave sharing this with the forum, being so open is very hard for a lot of people but you have found the strength to reach out. Do you have much support at home? How are you feeling now?

I was diagnosed with psychotic episodes around the age 24 - I was also prescribed anti depressants, and i feel my diagnosis was closer to psychotic depression. My depression started in my late teens. The depression did lift but the psychotic features remained - i am still psychotic 18 years later.

I got diagnosed with depression first.. At around 20.. i was well suicidal and did allot of hard core self harm... I've been on meds ever since.. 27 years of junk... They changed my diagnosis all the time when i was younger.. They almost put me on lithium at one point.. Then they thought i was schizophrenic for a while.. Basically I've been on meds my entire adult life.

I've had depression when I was about 35, but it lifted before I had my first psychosis age 39. They diagnosed me psychosis nos but it could have been something else too. Over the years the voices have disappeared with medication and I'm more or less functioning normally six years later. Diagnosis unchanged. Never had anti depressants. I still take a moderate dose of Orap, an antipsychotic. I used to take Risperdal, which I once weaned off of but too early and I relapsed within six months. I've had about three attempts to wean off the orap, the last over a year ago, all of which ended in severe insomnia and some semi-psychotic symptoms.

crazy my voices tell me the world in which we live in is not real it sets us challenges if we meet them which i would say is inevitable i mean how can u not it strengthens our resolve life is never long enough after all it is not forevever so try i know what it is like i have them myself they are naughty and nice a balancing act as it were a bit like theresa and boris over here you are strong sometimes it is hard to remember what we have achieved in the past think good thoughts my friend never forget we are all special and do not deserve a early close live life to the full

i know there is nothing wrong with planning ahead - considerate of you but dont you think you are giving them what they want this is your life yes i know it is up to you. I once asked something on the board a long while ago before the voices why do we live it said to feel to see to hear in other words to use all our senses and experience life being on the other side will be boring u know that why do you think there is reincarnation we have free will our choices can change other peoples lives - i love your posts some are quite amusing you strike me as a confident person there are others that go through exactly what me and you have be strong

there is not way it would be mostly healed by Monday! I hope you manage not to harm yourself. stick it out till you get your benefits. it seems like a right nightmare over there.

What are you struggling with ? Maybe if we can fix that you won't need to self harm

I like to see the aftermath. I have no support atm either so really struggling with low mood, voices, visions, organising, making decissions and staying safe

If you go to the hospital and they treat you they will contact a shrink about you.. And maybe they can sort out some support for you... Start the ball rolling kind of thing

I've been put on metroazapine or something like that for now and they have fastracked my psychologist appointment

Ah yes that's what I'm on. Was originally going on something different until I pipe up about my sleeping

It's just not right that they won't take you seriously until you actually go to that extent. I really hope your meds and psychologist help. Please stay in touch here.

self harm is addictive and doesn't work for long unfortunately. It is something to avoid getting into the habit of if you can. I have bipolar 2 as well and know how difficult it is to cope with at times. CAn you manage to just live in the moment and not look back or forward in that moment and live through it. Otherwise I am glad you found the forum a place to just talk and explore your feelings. Hold on in there and know that you can make it through this and you are in the best place to do this. My thoughts are with you.

I have got a couple of tips from another forum to distract my self as well as being a spiritualist so am well into meditation.

GREAT that you are into meditation. I hope its helpful. We have a piece on distraction in the top of the forum area. Take care

How long has she been self-harming do you think/know? Very disturbing news for you I can imagine. The part about getting involved with 'bad crowd' could really mean anything without more info (not that suggesting you should post it by the way!) - what sort of bad crowd?

So sorry, this is very hard for parents. We love our children unconditionally and deeply...and it hurts us to see them hurt themselves. It is good that she is seeing a psychologist. Perhaps you and your husband want to consider seeing a therapist together to talk about how to handle the specific issues that are coming up. You still want to parent your child and that may require discipline to continue to form her into a responsible adult. It might help to get support in the best approach to doing this. There may also be parent support groups for parents dealing with these issues. She is only fifteen, it is understandable that you are concerned about who she is socializing with. Kids at this age can be very persuaded and influenced. You and your husband need support right now. This may also lead to family counseling where the three of you can openly discuss issues and perhaps understand the needs of each other. You are the parents, it is wise not to ignore the signs that something is not right or that your daughter might be making poor choices. If you belong to a church, perhaps you can speak to the pastor. You love her and want the best for her. Children at 15 are not able to know what is best. I hope you can find the resources you need to get through this. Stay strong!

To try answer your questions, unsure why the police would be involved but if they were and had concerns for your safety they may ask for a mh assessment. It would depend on circumstances whether you would be sectioned. It isn't a crime to (try to) take your life, again would depend on what had happened, circumstances, as to whether police would interview. Sounds as though you are ready to /need to ask for help if you are thinking about suicide and also about surviving an attempt. You can go to A+E and ask for assessment or call crisis team number to talk to them? I understand feeling desperate and suicidal, am there myself. But think there is hope for you if you are thinking about what if you survive, you can seek help, hope you do x

I guess that depends on how you're planning on doing it - and please don't write specifics here as you're not allowed to. If someone calls the police / ambos because they can see that you're about to do something, then they will try and talk you down. They're not going to stand by and let you do something to yourself (and potentially other people). If they talk you down, then you'll be taken to hosptial (I would guess) and assessed from there.

you'd likely be sectioned for a failed public suicide attempt, assuming sectioned means sent to a psych ward.

It sounds to me that you are doing as much as you can to support your daughter. She will need to build up trust with you little by little. Asking for help when you Self harm is a frightening thing. There is such a stigma around it. She also may feel that she doesn't want to burden you, that she has failed you in some way, that she is unworthy of help and support. Self harm is a way of release, of stress, of mental pain that she is feeling. I can completely understand that this bullying is the trigger for it. Its such a cruel world we live in and kids can be the cruellest picking on the vulnerable ones amongst them. Talking really does help so if you can get her some professional help in that area that should help her deal with the need to self harm.

I don't think removing her from the bullying environment is such a good idea. What happens when she has to enter the real world. She can't hide from everything. I suggest getting her to a therapist who can help her to develop coping strategies to deal with the bullying and whatever else is going on with her at school. Also, I don't know your level of schooling yourself, but if she wants to get into college, I am not sure that homeschooling is a proper amount of credit to get her enrolled. I don't know, but that is something you might want to look into. Often times, people look to solve the problem right in front of them instead of looking for a long term solution.

I think it was a good idea to remove her from the bullying, she will hopefully be stronger when she works. The self harm has become a coping mechanism, she will learn how to cope with a non-violent means. You doing everything you can, maybe when she's older she might like to join the forum. You sound like a very caring parent, please do let us know how she's doing.

I agree go to the police, I'm sorry this was done to you. Visit your GP as a short course of medication might help, you may need counselling as well. I hope you feel better soon. I'm here to listen anytime.

I have all the evidence but I feel like the poster won't be punished and will run free and continue to do worse, like send the photos to my parents. I feel like the police cannot help me remove all the links that come up on google when my name is searched.

It's not too late. You have nothing to be ashamed of, go to the police, revenge porn is treated in the same way as sexual assault because of the devastating consequences to its victim's. Be brave and be strong. This man will be punished. You have done nothing wrong.

I wanted to add that self-punishment could also be negative reinforcement. So, would that change your view on it? Calling it negative reinforcement to stop yourself from giving in to a bad habit, for example?

Some schools of thought believe in negative reinforcement. Some people keep a rubber band around their wrist and snap themselves when they say a swear word, have the urge to use a substance, think of binge eating, etc. So long as its only as obtrusive as a snap from a rubberband I don't see it as harmful, but if you need a bandage after then that is harmful.

Are you the person to whom you refer ?? You show good insight to know the stalking is inappropriate

i also tend to feel my emptiness by buying something. I can't stop it no matter how seriously it makes me have financial problems. That's my life and I know I'm stupid.

I wish I could say something to help you but I have the opposite problem, I can't spend money. I'm just sooo obsessed with saving it up.

I also have a problem with spending. I buy too many clothes, craft supplies, food. Sometimes it's fun, there's a bit of a high that I get when I buy something that's not a pure necessity, but then I feel anxious again about having spent so much money. There are 2 places where I shop that have a rewards program, and I always get promotions in emails for points on food and various other items, some of which are necessities, and others, not so much. I'm going to have to reign in my spending now, because I am jobless and back in university for another year.

I used worry what people thought of me, And didn't like speaking in public, I also don't like how i sound, And kept myself to myself, But, People would make stories up about me, Stuff i haven't done, So, I turned it around, I started speaking out, I went out of my way to know people, I learnt not to worry about what people thought, I made people know me, If they didn't like me, Its not my problem. Start small, Then keep pushing yourself, Only you know when you are ready. don't let fear control you, Remove the fear.

I’m alone too - a widow - and find travelling and socialising especially hard. I am learning to cope and can now travel around by train and across London without any help. I do still get nervous but have decided to keep going anyway as I can have panic attacks just in the house when I am not under any pressure. The trick in my case has been to write down every single aspect of the journey before hand. Time I need to leave the house, time of bus, time of train, carriage and seat number. VERY precise directions about each stage of the journey - get off train, turn left to ticket barrier, turn left to station exit etc. And I tick off each stage when it is managed. It is more a case of managing the fear rather than overcoming it. And it can go wrong. On my last trip the train station was having some reconstruction work done and I ended up at an exit I didn’t recognise - in the dark!!!! Happened over a week ago and I am only just recovering. The other thing that helps, if you have a mobile phone, have some support back up from an understanding friend or relative who can talk you through the situation if things do come totally unstuck.

I can relate rather well to this because me and my brother are pretty similar. I do not think you specified the root to your anxiety but Anyway assuming we're on the same page one thing you can possibly change is your perspective on things, try remember that your situation is their situation, in other words do you care/judge others when you go out? no and some people that you see are probably somewhat socially awkward themselves. Remember other people aren't out there to judge you they're busy doing their own thing. Relax and have fun.

I have no real idea about clothing material but i do know that i don't like big heavy jumpers.

When I was a kid I once had to wear some really itchy trousers. It was horrible. We did a day trip to France that day. In the end, I think i got some pyjamas to wear underneath, but it was still itchy.

Any jumpers irritate me a little, same with woollen hats, and scarves. When I was a kid, the feeling of having hair down my back after a haircut made me so upset I'd have to have my hair cut at home so I could instantly go into the shower, and I'd refuse to wear the shirt I got my hair cut in no matter how many times it was washed. Nowadays I'm much better about that, but it's still a bit annoying to me.

Do you have limited interests? With the interests you do have, are you able to have immense focus for abnormally long periods of time, and master your interests at high level? Do you have a strict schedule you have to stick to, and feel out of sorts if your unable to? Are you awkward socially, or have to mask emotions or personality to fit norms? These are some of the most common characteristics of having ASD. If you can relate to these, then you most likely have it.

My ex-boyfriend has Asperger's. He is highly intelligent, focused and methodical, with an odd, very dry sense of humour. He's quiet and awkward around people and often talked about not being able to show emotion like he thought was proper. Like me, social situations make him anxious. He has often been depressed and irritable but I don't recall any sudden mood swings.

I have lived with someone diagnosed with aspergers and someone else with BPD and I can only say those two people were entirely dissimilar and their particular problems did not 'overlap' in any way. I think you need to do more research. These two conditions are not similar at all.

it must be difficult to be patronised and not treated like the adult you are. i don't have autism but i have had MH issues since before i was a teenager and because i am unable to live a fully independent life i find i get patronised somewhat to it really isn't fair to you and must be so frustrating ,the most important thing though is that YOU know you are an adult and YOU know what you are capable of

As a fellow sufferer of Aspergers, I understand how you feel. I think it's important to be around people that support you, rather than belittle everything you do. Perhaps they don't know they are doing it though, so it's worth talking to them about what they do and how it makes you feel. Keep doing what you love - I'm sure you're great at writing plays and literature!x

Definitely be around people who will support and help you - that's a must. Problem is, for many of us, we don't even know what the issues are, or what the hell is going on, and why things go wrong, for many, many years, even our whole lives in some cases. I'm pushing 50, and have only just been diagnosed. There are those who will quite happily use your weaknesses against you - and you don't even know they are doing it at the time. It's later. A lifetime later in some cases. Well, fuck that

I've had a schizophrenia diagnosis, but have recently been tested for, and diagnosed with, ASD, and have been offered a Life Coach with the adult service The tests are very thorough, and are in three stages. It's well worth going down that path, and it makes a lot of sense, and starts to answer many puzzles, niggles and questions you've had about life, fitting-in, what's going wrong etc, once you get into it. Chase that doctor up, and see what comes of it

i think you have empathy. although we haven't talked much on a one to one. you have helped me before and showed a lot of empathy. you probably don't remember but i do ,a few years ago i posted about abuse. and another time thinking i was a monster ,and you were really kind and supportive

I have a relative who gets very involved with fictional characters' emotions in books, films, will go into a lot of detail re what has happened to them and why and how awful it is if they are struggling in anyway. But they struggle to recognise the feelings and situations of people around them in real life or show compassion. I don't know if being able to empathise with fictional characters/a fictional world is somehow "safer"? I think this is still a form of empathy but at a distance some how. Don't know, just my thoughts, experience. Am flooded with far too much empathy, it doesn't help anyone really and hurts a lot

I hate eye contact but know it is expected, especially if you're asking for help. I look disgusting and want to avoid seeing the judgement in other peoples eyes. One thing that kinda worked was wearing some clear lens glasses instead of my proper ones. I am short sighted and thus those clear lens ones give me the comfort of the psychological barrier betwixt me and them AND since I cant make out their facial expressions I don't notice any urrrghhh reaction to me.

I usually just make sporadic eye contact - look, hold for a few seconds, look away - there’s no point in getting into staring contests. Sometimes for emphasis I’ll hold eye contact a bit longer, but I find it uncomfortable as well. I think most people do, and so it’s perfectly fine not to make eye contact in most cases. I do make eye contact with girls I find attractive. Can’t help it, I just like looking into their eyes.

Like a lot of things in life, a balance between the two is probably best. You're right - you don't want to avoid their eye contact completely, but you also don't want to stare them down. I think it's best to hold eye contact for a few seconds at a time - not too short to seem like you're not listening, but not too long to seem that you are staring into their soul

My view on this is that everyone goes through life doing the best that they can, given the background that circumstances and their parents gave them. Perhaps that psychiatrist was abused as a child, you don’t know. But I feel that people inherently do what they can to make a good life for themselves and their loved ones. So when we come across people who hurt us, it’s often that they are carrying out patterns that they have inherited from their parents, teachers and so on. The whole process of rectifying these things, of introducing greater compassion and removing old inherited harm, is something that psychologists have been working at for ages. The process of working through our own trauma is something that takes time. Finding ways to love ourselves, forgive ourselves for things we did which in hindsight were maybe not right, accept ourselves in the present moment and in the past, these things are all difficult but very worthwhile. It’s good to spend time and effort on introspection, on why things are the way they are, and finding some love for that boy with Tourette’s.

When I was arrested by the Counter Terrorism Police in 2010, I was sectioned. I made it clear I would have a proper pop at them and the NHS in court. One of the officers said he was keen to see me 'get the help and support' I needed. He, for his own part, probably meant it. I was sectioned, and left to the dirty twats in the NHS. I have tried long and hard to resolve this matter. But so far, I have only spoken to the Police and the NHS themselves about the matter. Sometimes nicely. Sometimes not so nicely. It was recently said: 'have you ever known the coppers not to respond to someone so distressed....' I made two 999 calls, and the Police threatened me saying: 'Don't call again. Or we'll come and see you'. Wow. Just fucking Wow. Talking to the Police and the NHS about this now is a fat, useless, waste of time. But there is such a thing as charitable and unbiased victim support. And there are such a thing as journalists and lawyers The Police and the NHS officials who have been involved in my case, need to know that no matter how much shit they throw in my direction, and no matter how black a picture their stitch-up ambush seeks to paint of me, that will reflect on them also. And much, much more than they have prepared for. They have had their chance, and now I am taking it forward, to an open court if necessary. And there's nothing they can do about it. I intend to hold the professionals as accountable as possible, and metaphorically rip their fucking heads off and their hearts out, and lay them to waste on their own turf I am going to make them known, and put an end to them.

The cowardly, dirty, corrupt, vermin police and NHS officials, who have shafted me, covered things up so as not to be accountable, ambushed me to make it harder for me to complain and have the confidence to seek effective redress, need to know fully: all their dirty, dirty work has been in vain, and they have FAILED I am going to knock them down. just to add, I have NEVER been so committed to anything, in my entire life. I am going to choke the life out of the corrupt Police and NHS twats in court, and knock them the fuck out anyway I can.

I suffered from terrible head shaking and blinking as a child when going through relentless physical and mental abuse off parents, family members and other kids my age, it got to the point i couldn't concentrate on anything because of it and the abuse i got off people got even worse because of it. I thought it was me with the problem and blamed myself for years. When i started reading psychology books in my late teens and into my 20s then i woke up to the problem not being me, it was all the bastards giving me shit all my life. I took control of my life and read up on all kinds of subjects then became confident to the pint of arrogance and i showed noting but contempt to all and anyone who tried to put me down. My ticks stopped and for the last 20 years i only ever get them if i am stressed. i find they stop when i try not to focus on them, forget you have ticks and they seem to go away, or at least thats what i have found over the years.

I have created such a scheme: our emotions have impact on our thoughts and our thoughts - on our actions. When changing emotional state we are changing our actions as result. Now I will try different methods to control my emotional state. Emotional state does not mean just sad or happy. It is a very complex phenomenon.

It doesn't look like it effects dopamine, but I only looked quickly, the TD thread was about antipsychotics which antagonise (restrict) dopamine. Escitalopram looks to be a SSRI which means it mainly works on serotonin (by increasing it). Wikipedia says "SSRI can rarely cause extrapyramidal side effects including akathisia through the indirect inhibition of dopamine" but whether TD is recorded I don't know. Stick to your guns, it's criminal how every time someone diagnosed with a mental health diagnosis has complex health issues due to the meds they describe they fob us off and put it down to mental health to cover their arses. To try and stick us back on the same substance which caused us such harm is sickening. I'm fighting that fight myself and know how it feels, but if we don't fight for ourselves and each other who will. I think the one thing we should all try and do is make it easier for those who face the same problems after us. For me it makes my experiences mean something if others can benefit. The main way I can think of is by reporting side effects of meds online and to the relevant bodies. In the UK that body is https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ and I encourage anyone with bad side effects to report them if they feel they have the strength to do it, because not enough Doctors are doing this which reinforces their head in the sand approach by making side effects look rarer and less significant in the stats. You can report side effects to rxisk.org too and print off a report to take to your Doctor if you like. If your Doctors wont listen advocate for yourself and insist on finding ones that will. If you're not up to doing that find an advocate and ask them to do it for you.

The information I read earlier stated that this condition could be sparked by any substance / drug which "disagreed" with a patient. It cited sertraline and one other SSRI which had provided evidence of patients being diagnosed with this condition on withdrawl. So SSRIs can affect you too perhaps. There is perhaps less evidence with these drugs being less "heavy duty" than the anti-psychotics and perhaps having been observed less...particularly the newere SSRIs - of which Escitalopram is one. I knew about the reporting system and did indeed report the drug using the yellow card system. I have tried for several years to be taken seriously over this, and have ended up in the psychiatrist's chair! He seems determined to trash my concerns. The cardiologists were far quicker to consider psychiatric drugs as the cause, although they felt that what I suffered could not be termed "withdrawl symptoms." I am questioning whether it is worth the fight. I am much better now and, in terms of my heart, nothing can be done. It is better perhaps to come to terms with it, limit further derrogatory psychiatric investigations and to deal with the resulting increase in anxiety as best I can with therapy. Seeking help from professionals who use pills is the last thing that I want....so why turn to drug prescribers for advice and help? That's my view, although the bitterness and anger still burns very deeply I must admit.

I had dyskinesia of my tongue and mouth just over a year ago, amd I still do to a much milder extent. It was caused by antipsychotic drugs...in particular the less sedating older ones, although years of AP's in general could not have helped. I thimk for people in there mid twenties (my age), obvious TD is still relatively umcommon. Only yesterday I was told I will still have to avoid non sedating and older antipsychotics. Whatever the theoretical debates on this about the risks of different antipsychotics, it seems the general consensus and reality (in my view amd experience) is that certain antipsychotics place us at higher risk than others, although that is not to say they are less safe overall. I don't think SSRI's would give you TD, as that's not the way they work. I heard that lithium can, in extremely rare circumstances, cause TD - although I don't know how true this is. About the relationship betweem TD and tourettes - it seems unlikely, as older dopamime blocking drugs (that very heavily target what they call the nigrostriatal pathway - drugs doing this are a cause of TD and movement problems) are sometimes used to TREAT tourettes!
