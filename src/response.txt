Unfortunately, you can't hide from pain, trauma or abuse. Try to learn from your experience, avoid situations where you feel like your friends are taking advantage of you and stand your ground. You are not weak, you are learning.

I empathize with you on this OP - best of luck in your future.

Unless a medical professional says otherwise, and since nobody else has said it: please go to CAPS and/or the Ashe Clinic. That symptom definitely seems alarming to me.

This is unfortunately a very common problem nowadays. I've been there. I felt like my family could't recognize me after long periods of isolation in school. It is scary because it is new, and also alarming. Socialization is necessary for a healthy brain. Make sure to engage on friendships, listen and empathize with your friends.

I feel you, as an immigrant I can say that many of us are treated like second class citizens. I'm one of the DACA dreamers and I had to deal with similar occurrences. It is revolting and she is the devil!

To those who have hit rock bottom or feel like they're losing their minds or are bearing the weight of each day on their shoulders or are bearing the weight of loneliness in their heavy hearts, others feel it too. You are not alone. Scream until you're listened to. Scream until your pain is heard. It's easier to feel your bones shake and to break down in the office of a psychiatrist than it is to wear the same disguise of everything is okay when nothing is right. And it's fine if other people find out that you aren't okay because one day you will be. Maybe not now. Maybe not tomorrow. But one day you will be. That's how getting better works. It's a process. Go talk to your doctor or your insurance company or walk into urgent care and say you need help. Do what you need to do to get better and that ALWAYS involves getting help from others.

I'm here to be messaged to as well. I usually hear about it as dissociation, but I've been experiencing it my whole life and am totally cool with talking to you and introducing you to people.

Hey, I've experienced this a lot as well. There are actually a lot of ways to re-ground yourself back. It is hard to do but can be overcome. If you want to,I am down to hang and get food. Shoot me a message? Its pretty scary at first but don't be too alarmed, you are not alone.

Going to premed is not easy and requires some level of isolation, which results in what you are describing. Why don't you try to study with friends or classmates?
c
:( I can help :) just feel free to message me. I would love to talk. Hopefully I can be of some help to you.

Hi, always here to talk if you want someone to vent to or need support<3

I’m not a Bruin, so sorry if that disqualifies me, but I am hear to talk, send me a message!

 I’d love to help. Message me!

Bruin Alumni here! I deal with this everyday, and would love to chat. Please message me! :)

Hi

I mean, you don't necessarily have to take a south campus major for pre-med. You can be North campus and just fulfill the necessary pre requisites for med school admissions

All us North Campus majors are also dead inside, but we do a better job of faking life.

This is so fucking true.

I guess, ask yourself why you went into Pre-Med? Either: - You did it for a very good, passionate reason, and you should always keep that in the forefront of your mind. That passion is your individuality and the focus that will sustain you. - You did it because you felt compelled by someone or something... but never really wanted to do it. If that’s the case, try to figure out what subjects you are passionate about and pursue those.

Alex Tan i need your energy around me

So true, south campus is either basic af or a boring robot

Give yourself permission to take a break! You are a lovely individual and your major (and uni as a whole, really) wants you to feel your major is your only source of worth. Please continue to do the good and wonderful work that you do. But schedule (please for the love of everything, schedule it so you can look forward to it!) five hours a week to watch that new show with friends, do that dance workshop, joke with the wine club, and reclaim your personality.

Esther Kang This is why I decided to switch to north cam major while still doing premed

Tian-Zheng Wei it me

OP speaks of the unspoken. At least they realize that the future can happen, but does take initiative to plan and anticipates.

Rock bottom is the best place to build a strong foundation for a glorious future :) Just have to keep on trucking!

So sorry to hear that life had been tough. Let me see if I have your story straight. You feel worthless because of your personality, ie a core part of you that you feel you cannot change. You think that people would not like or want to be friends with you. You probably stick to yourself and not actively try to make friends or you do and you fail. This makes you feel worthless again and continues the loop. Your feels, thoughts, and behavior is conspiring against you. This is a classic example a downward spiral. Please visit CAPS at your next convenience. Once you see your therapist, tell then that you are spiraling. They will help you. Your problem is not small. It is growing but it can be nipped in the bud. You sound motivated to change and really self aware, so I know you can do this!

To OP: First, I am so sorry that you are going through this. I have dealt with many similar feelings that you are going through right now. In the past I’ve struggled to have a sense of self-worth and self-confidence, and though I have gotten better these feelings still persist to an extent today. Second, I want to assure you that things, though will take time, will get better, even if you may not feel so. Trust me, I’ve felt that way a lot too, where I thought things would not get better. But as long as you try to make things better, even if they are small steps, trust me, they will get better. Lastly, I want to assure you that you are worthy of being here, and no one deserves to feel how you are feeling. Please feel free to message me if you want to talk. Also I encourage you to try out CAPS, but I understand if you don’t find it helpful (I personally didn’t find it that helpful for me as I prefer to talk to friends or at least peers about my problems).

Call this number: (310) 825-0768. That’s UCLA Counseling and Psychlogical Services (CAPS). Just say exactly what you wrote here and that you’d like to come in for a screening. It’s on campus, right next to the Wooden Center, and you can walk in any time Mon-Fri, 9a-4p. Seriously, they’re miracle workers. They’ll help you figure out how to feel better, grow, and thrive. I’m happy to help if you have more questions.

It is a shame your self-worth is so low. But, it doesn’t have to be. Your life and your attitude towards it is self-determined. If you have a “shitty” personality, change it to a pleasant one. Personality is a choice -- not something that you inherited. A true friend requires work. So, work on it. Talk about them only. Ask them questions. Soon enough, they will take a real interest in you. Don’t think suicide ever. You can do this because it isn’t that hard. It is simply a choice to be made. Good luck.

Ayy same

LSD/MDMA can bring out both anhedonia and depression but I don't believe it can not cause it. You should consider that just because you didn't notice before, doesn't mean you it wasn't there. I've been suicidal since I was a child and in fact LSD helped me with some of it. I don't have a good advice about stopping your depression since I can't stop my own. I just accepted it, somedays I will be sad, somedays I will be happy, someday I am both. Consider that this might just be you growing up and knowing a bit more of yourself.

'Things will get better'. Let me tell you this is the biggest lie in the history of lies. People tell me this all the time--when I'm having suicidal thoughts, after a suicide attempt, and even when I'm strapped to a hospital bed. They've told me this after they learned how I was destroyed as a child by other people. They are wrong. Things are the same.
What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

Alli Kang this post is actually right on.

To Whom it May Concern, Here is a skit idea for Spring Sing this year: a classic old-timey western movie gun fight scene set in the middle of bruin walk but instead of guns they use bananas. w/ love, A banana loving undergrad

Ends with someone from Covel scolding you for taking more than one banana?

I know things will work out for you eventually. If you continue taking classes at a local college and bring your GPA up again, you can always re-apply to UCLA or an equivalent prestigious university. So many good stories of people redeeming themselves so I know it's not the end for ya. Good luck 👍 - H

Trust me, there are a lot of people in the world that might have the exact same sense of dirty humor, you just have to take the risk to talk to them and not feel insecure. The fact that you never had a boyfriend is overwhelming but it doesn't define you.

...The good news: it's even simpler than that. Obviously it'll vary based on the circumstances some, but basically you just have to fill out the readmission application, talk to an adviser, and make a contract about how many classes you can take and when and what grades you need to achieve, etc. ... And then you enroll in your classes like usual (usually through UNEX in what's called concurrent enrollment) and move on. **Disclaimer: I am not an academic adviser... I just have far, far too much personal experience with this. XD**

There's also a process where you don't even have to fill out the readmission application and simply write an appeal letter. - Astra Abbas

Hi OP. Please contact us (and Matthew Lindauer) if you're able to. Someone messaged us and said that s/he was also dismissed but got back a week later, and would like to help you. Thanks - H

f the poster is reading this, PM me. I was dismissed years ago. It's really... really not the end. You have options. Lots of them. The Bruin Readmission Program is absolutely incredible (Once a Bruin, always a Bruin), and it's the first thing you should look at. Happy to share my experience and help you figure out what resources you have which you are probably not aware of.

You have the opportunity to appeal the dismissal by writing a descriptive letter explaining why you were not able to bring up your grades, how you'll improve and etc. After reviewing it, the dismissal can be taken back with a written contract that you must follow. You were admitted to the #1 public university for a reason, don't give up so easily. Let me know if you need help.

I think a good way to look at it is to think of how it can become a great inspirational story once you bounce back! Keep at it and don't give up! One day you will be able to tell your story to inspire those who may be in your shoes in the future or maybe even now ❤️

Look into the Bruin readmission program.

Don't let this one setback define you! Keep fighting to get back up!

These secrets really freak me out that would be my worst nightmare

I hope things get better for you

Johnny Tian-Zheng Wei dude this is me after the typology and coding theory double whammy

Please do not submit the same secret multiple times within a span of few minutes. We usually have a backlog of secrets to post, so please be patient as we would get to yours eventually. Thanks. - H

They have churros?!

Brenda Chan deneve worker

While you have no reason to listen to this, you don't know me and you seem to be very set in your decision, please don't kill yourself. Depression and anhedonia are terrible, and living with them is horrible but please give it some more time. This is a brain injury, not unlike a concussion or a stroke and it takes time to heal. The brain is incredibly slow at healing itself. It often takes months and several different medications before you find the right one to mitigate the symptoms for you. Please, just don't give up so soon. While memory loss is better than suicide, the possibility of being able to feel happiness is even better than that. Just a little more time OP, for your friends, your family, but most importantly for yourself. You can get through this. Let the people around you support you and if you need more than that, we can change the first sentence I said and you can message me. I'm no one special, just willing to be a friend if you need another.

Also a lot people on here are acting like trolls and the mods should crack down and ban them. Suicide is no laughing matter, shame on them. Makes me disgusted to go to the same school as them.

2 months isn't very long in terms of recovering from a brain injury.

This is like saying I had 0% runny nose before the cold and I will NOT accept a runny nose. Deal with the circumstances you have now. Not before.

Try the LSD / MDMA combo again. Maybe it will shock your brain to where it was before.

Do you do anything at all to manage your depression other than hoping group therapy, therapy, and meds will do something for you? If you're too tired to do anything else and you're feeling suicidal, it's time to check yourself into a hospital. I recommend Ronald Reagan if you have the UCLA insurance. Their service is great and the staff is lovely. You deserve to be alive. You deserve to see a smile one day in your reflection and feel it mirrors the joy you will one day have again.

studies have shown that CBT over a long period of time will change your brain chemistry in the same ways that meds do. it does work, but its not a miracle cure all that will instantly solve all your problems. you need to put the work in if you want to get better.

Whoever this was, can you please message me? I’d like to talk to you...

Message me. Start a fake account if you wish to preserve your anonymity. I've known a few cases of this.

If the therapy isn't working, then start running around the campus. Run to Wilshire, and then back up Veteran if you have to. Make strategic Spotify playlists to lift your mood while you run. It's good to run in the morning, and gaze at the horizon. Anhedonia is just apathy and insatiability, it's common to feel this way. You can tap into your subtle body and stimulate that which you're repressing. The brain is malleable, and nerves can heal themselves. Steve Jobs did acid to btw.

this is from the molly, not the acid. stay away from molly.

Does the realization of the absurd require suicide?

You talk about yourself as a decent person with decent qualities, but likeable is not one of them. Would you find yourself likeable at all? Could you expect people to like you if you imagine scenarios of people not liking you, as you are in effect actively finding reasons to not like yourself? Are you being too hard on yourself by defining likeable as having the approval of people who will genuinely like me, text me, and email me whenever I message them? Is it more assumable to think that keeping to yourself too much is making it hard for people to find things in common with you?

Acquiring true friends takes a lot of work. Most people don't take the time to filter out those who really don't fit their life. So, I would recommend taking a close look at your acquaintences and figure out who you think would add value to your life. Then, carefully but frequently, invite them personally (not an email or text) to get together with you for a meal or a drink. Then, when you're together, focus exclusively on that person. Ask about their interests, their likes and dislikes etc. If they ask about you, answer simply without long explanations. They will react very positively to that experience and you'll be well on your way to creating a very special bond with them. If you see a guy to whom you are attracted, just be very nice to him and he'll soon get the idea that you're interested. Good luck!

Justin Ambrosio same feeling. But wonder who wrote this

all these false priests and charlatan of eCONomists use their unrealistic assumptions like perfect rationality and self interested actors to maintain the dominance of the rootless capitalist rent seekers by spreading the twisted sick dogma of neoliberalism. there was this one time i read an article on behavioral economics so it's pretty clear to me the whole field is a sham.

Wesley Cheng lmao math intensive

Adrian Lee this is too true and I hate this major too

Shane Figueroa yikes

Andy Chen

Act as if you suspect nothing. You don't have any 'ammunition' to use to do anything other than trying your best to get through the class and into another professor's class who will likely also do the same. Life is the way it is and it is difficult to change individually. Most individuals in a postion to do something are unwilling to go out on a limb so they perpetuate the discrimination. Take a deep breath and plug on. You'll be ok.

I might be wrong but this seems like good practice for the field you are going to be in. Politics and law isn't for the thin-skinned.

Justin Ambrosio thought this was you until I realized you don't eat gelato or maybe but def not mini golf

That's adorable. Good luck OP <3

this aint about me but imma act like it's about me to make my night better cuz I wear glasses and am a boy and also was in Kerckhoff at some point in this month.

Melody Lim u already know

Kira O'Connor Not sure if it's you but you certainly fit the bill so maybe? also OP, I don't think it's weird. They're students just like you are :P But maybe be careful about asking out the RA if they're for your floor until next year, /just/ in case it goes south.

I tried it before, but failed terribly. For me, not worth it.

Its Anthony DiChiara and christina Alex Negulescu Nick Semo PJ Negulescu John Takiff

Getting the guy to talk to her is only going to make things worse.

Having the guy talk to her is not going to help.

do you think you could get her to get some professional help as well?
having the guy talk to her could just be a temporary fix, so getting help at CAPS or something would be better to get at the root of the problem

I dont think at this point she is strong enough to confront with him again.... He is a sad memory that she wants to get rid of her life... Breaking up is a hard issue and only her can help herself. :( May be you suggest her to share this with someone who she trusts, like her Mom or her best friends. That will help!

Hey Friend! You've lost a lot of weight since I last saw you and now I'm really worried. I think you need to get professional help ASAP. I not doing anything until seven, so can we walk in together? We can grab some dinner together afterwards too.

I'll talk to her Alice Lee. I'll get her to eat more

Shagufah Ajmal BURHHH I thought you wrote this about me AHHAHAHAH

That is a terrible way to grow up! However, it is now your choice as to how you want it to affect your life. You can be a victim forever if you choose. Or, you can get it behind you if you choose. I think you should seek professional assistance and over time, put your past behind you and be the courageous, trusting woman you were meant to be. And, don’t be afraid to talk about your past and don’t be shamed by it. Take a deep breath and take the first step to getting past this.

Best wishes. Hopefully your current interest will be understanding of your situation and it will last? :) I don't know if you've talked to them about your concerns, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try

Why in the world do you care what they do.....? So what? Maybe he has mental issues, maybe he's struggling and you don't even know and here you are judging them

Find an equally unsocial girl and maybe they can get together

He probably has the best grades in the building though. Maybe he just wants a good future.. lol.

This was me last year but you should talk to your roommate more.

The problem as you said is you THINK. Thinking is a very good thing, and it also can be a big trouble depending on circumstances. Good luck.

Sounds like someone finally reached puberty.. The hormones are starting to rage!

This is so wholesome. I love this. And, it is a crush!

I read this in a pirate accent.

all the guys I talk to Likely a case of sampling bias. Consider modifying the sampling methodology.

If all the guys you talk to are like that, then you might be hanging out in an area with a high concentration of thirsty guys. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy thing, since you're not exactly going to meet people who study at home on Thursday nights.

Michael McCallion Benjamin Ihlefeld me whenever I start trying to be friends with guys in my classes I just want to be friends goddammit!

I feel this too. You aren’t alone. Great friends, it’s still not enough. Be careful who you make deeper connections with, because when they stop being your friend, it really hurts. I hope you find what you need

You are an angel. And it's good to know that UCLA has a student like you!

When I asked a classmate to exchange contact information and the person gave me his/her email address

That was touching, you are a good person,

anon thank you so much for these kind words if u dont mind i'd like to talk to u !

 I feel this post. I still struggle with this

Don't feel too bad. Real friends should only be good for 2 things. To have sex with and/or for a drinking partner. Get a therapist to talk about your feelings. They will actually listen.

People are busy at this school. Keep busy and you won't worry. Had the same problem

THE ACCURACY ! sending you good vibes always +hugs+

I feel this post.

Joanne Reyes another sad boi

Well... it's hard to make really deep connections to people. But you can only ever keep trying :) I'm down if you want~

I miss the deep conversations too. Message me and i would love to do something with you sometime :)

Nonsense. You just need proper stimulation. Until it comes along, keep putting one foot in front of another and sooner rather than later, you'll recover what you think you've lost.

Lost it perhaps, but there may come a day that someone can help you find it again :) Until then, don't give up hope!

 Austin Lee I know we've been friends for four years but I can't keep it in any more

When you said she saved your life several times, it seems like a red flag. Maybe she wanted to be a partner, not a savior.

“The only girl I have wanted all of 2017” my god it must’ve been such a tragedy for you knowing you didn’t want her in 2016. And what about 2015? Why stop there? Lets include 2014 and 2013? Jesus dude it’s a girl, quit being a fucking bitch. Maybe that’s why she left you, you sound really beta. Lol

Life has its way of being unexpected - and that goes for both you and her. Based on your description, I imagine it was hard for her, too - but she has to do what she has to do for herself. My condolences for how you feel, and best wishes moving forward.

 I know it seems tough now --- but it will get better pretty quickly. Just keep your eyes open as you walk through the campus and I'm sure you'll see a number of women who will take your mind off of your last girlfriend. And, be grateful for the fact she broke up earlier rather than later because the longer it goes on, the more difficult it is to get out.

If It worked out for Aria and Ezra, it could work out for you and him

If It worked out for Aria and Ezra, it could work out for you and him

By all means, don't hesitate. After the quarter is over, go talk to him and let him know.

The problem here is the Prof is the one who gets fucked over here if things go south

Lol “really young”... I️ had an 18 y/o professor last fall (I was 21 at the time)

I think that particular person might just be that way. Sometimes people get harassed a lot by others propositioning them for sex - it's a defense mechanism to then be mean as a default state. Please don't let this deter you from continuing to hit people up as a friend :)

It doesn't sound like they're your friend, or like this response was totally out of the blue. If a person isn't interested in talking to you, you should be able to recognize it long before it gets to the point of such a blunt interaction.

What would you like to have done? The only gun control that is actually even slightly correlated to lowering gun deaths is absolute seizure of guns which is the dumbest idea ever. Mass murders account for roughly 0.1% of all gun deaths. Furthermore, gun control only targets rifles which while scary to look at contribute to a small fraction of gun deaths. The point I’m trying to make about the experiment we know as “gun control” is that there is zero correlation between legislative acts and lowering of gun deaths for the simple reason of... if you plan on committing a crime with a gun, the gun itself being illegal is irrelevant. Furthermore, when has further legislation ever prevented more crime? For instance how many deaths has making schools gun free zones prevented. How many deaths have bullet buttons and 30 round mags prevented. The answer is zero because those are all obtainable. I️ support legislation on stricter background checks and such and I️ support harsher sentences on owning illegal firearms and crimes for using them. Other than that, aside from outright mass confiscation, there’s nothing to be done.

the fact that the other person reached out to you is a good sign!! sometimes u just gotta remind them casually like Hey u wanna grab dinner this wk? etc. also perhaps theyre busy with midterms but little gestures like that i definitely appreciate :)

Is the supervisor young? If so, they may feel that their letter wouldn't carry much weight so feel you can do better with someone else providing your letter. If this sounds like the case, you may want to ask them if that's the reason, nothing to lose there. When quite possibly one of the best students (knowledge, work ethic, classroom presence & participation and so on, the whole package) in a class I TAed for asked me for a letter I was super hesitant to write one because I thought I'd be doing her a disservice and even if another one of her instructors wouldn't write quite as glowing of a letter, their average letter combined with their stature in the academic world would benefit her a lot more than my letter.

Just gotta find other people - don't rely on one person! :) Good luck

 rip south campus

These are some typical symptoms of depression. Go to CAPS and talk with a counselor.

 I think it is because videos show the number of views instead of just reactions -wheels

 apparently Facebook's algorithm is set to show videos more often + images are easier to steal and repost

hey, you do you if you're okay with being alone, but remember that not everyone can do that. it would be nice if I didn't get lonely, but I get lonely to the point of severe, impactful depression. that's not something I can just easily be okay with. so think before you say something like that so offhandedly

Honestly this is what I've been saying for ages. I love eating with friends when I can, but I have 0 issues eating alone.

 If you have jesus, are you ever really alone tho Ciara Nagao

You do realize there's a difference between being alone and being lonely right?

I love eating alone for the same reason!!!!

I'm so sorry you had that experience. :( Both someone saying that and your rape.

If it's any consolation at all, generally someone saying that is a pretty terrible person, and you may not have ended up in a healthy situation with them.

That's some incredible quotation etiquette there

Some people are hella immature. My advice is to just leave it. You can dive deep into the rabbit hole of psychology and never understand some things, it's not worth it. My guess is that she realized you're starting to like her, but she doesn't like you, and doesn't want to confront the awkwardness of talking to you about it. Or something like that. Another possibility is she met another guy and he doesn't like her hanging around you all the time. Or she wants to focus on schoolwork and finds hanging out with you distracting. Honestly, there's a million such variations but they all mean the same thing: Don't get attached to people until you know them for sure.
P.S. Spoken from experience.

Her reasons aren’t important. Her actions are and she, for whatever reason, doesn’t want you close to her. Accept it and be glad that you found out before you developed strong feelings for her.

Move on. She won't tell you what is on her mind and you can't read her mind. These people aren't worth the time. Go out and make some real friends.

Anne Tran Erica Xie don't fight my children

just tell them. Like you could say something like Hey I like jokes, but that one about death is just inappropriate. its awkward at first. But letting them know is better than leaving them in ignorance and you feeling uncomfortable.

You could always seek out understanding friends or consult with CAPS. My condolences and best wishes.

Perhaps talk to them about how you feel? If they're your friends they should understand and be willing to tone down the joking

I felt that way too as a freshman (and even part of my sophomore year) but it gets better over time! People can only hang on to their high school friends for so long. It may feel lonely right now but keep trying and eventually you will find people who will want to spend time with you. You're not alone. :)

Felt the same way. Learned to fly solo. Became badass. Then found stuff I valued more than friendship. Like ponies. Then I found real friends.

Thank you for having the courage to speak up. It is not your fault. You are not alone. There are many resources on campus for when you feel ready to talk, and I'm here as well. Don't go through it alone. CARE: http://www.careprogram.ucla.edu/

I’m so sorry this happened to you Please report this though. This guy could be harassing other women as well. Also remember the resources at school that provide therapy and such.

I feel for this women but i have a few questions. Why didnt you stop him in when he ran his hand down your leg?how did he manipulate you to go to your room then have sex ? Then you continued to have sex with him ?? Its not like he forced her to do anything. There seems to be two individuals with issues and problems

Whoever wrote this please message me. I'm afraid I might have had the same experience with this person.

Who raped you?

Why do you want good grades? Grades are just one of the indicators for how well you know the material of a class. It was designed to fit everybody, so in reality it fits no one. It is by far not the only indicator for how good you are in your field. It's up to you how much importance you want to prescribe to it. I was never a great studier or a fast learner, so I had a lower GPA than most of my friends. But for me, school wasn't about grades. School was an opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn, and a degree was just a stepping stone to future jobs. So I didn't stress so much about my grades, paid attention to the classes I liked, and focused the rest of my energy on personal projects. I never even put my GPA on my resume, my projects filled the gap, and I landed decent internships (tho some companies did ask for my GPA. I stopped caring about such closed-minded companies). Point is, there are so many other ways to get a job, like networking or doing research or getting recs. School isn't all about grades, it means whatever you want it to mean. So figure out what you want to get out of it, focus on what you're good at, and don't waste your four years trying to meet other people's standards.

Honestly, it takes a lot to get good grades here. If you have any sort of social life or a job, I'm amazed if you do well. I stress out and have mini breakdowns every quarter.. just do your best and don't let it kill you. Also, don't snort the adderall.. I know it's more fun, but it doesn't work the way it is supposed to if you snort it.. hope that helps. Lol.

 I disagree. I've found that if required tasks lead to procrastination, then - potential mental health issues aside - maybe you don't really want to do the thing, and should consider options which you actually enjoy doing (this is especially applicable to significant others). This is the only life you get, and your youth is fleeting - I promise that if you spend it disciplining yourself into following a path you're not enthusiastic about, you'll just grow to be a bitter and hateful adult who never stops wondering what if?

Best create opportunities from here. That being said, it will take time. Don’t mean to be hard, but mentality shifts when we are either in stress or feeling good. Never feel like you are holding yourself back. Do what you can do and feel bad if you are late bloomer at the same time. Individually, your determination can offer a lot more.

Damn I could easily have been the one to write this. Same exact situation (down to the GPA), same drive. Best of luck to you, you're not alone.

dont compare yourself to your 3.8 counterparts or you are gonna be sad forever. Accept yourself for who you are and move on. Do a post- bac and dont look bac - bb

I just met a woman who graduated from UCSF med school after completing her MPH at Johns Hopkins. BUT she did all of that after taking 4 gap years because she graduated from UCLA with a 2.6 GPA. In those gap years she worked on research that she was really passionate about. As long as you pursue your passions and really show growth in your gap years, anything is possible. If you really want to be a doctor, you will be. Perseverance is the epitome of the medical journey. Good luck, stay strong, and stay motivated. You'll get there. and. don't. compare. yourself. to. others.

AAMC provides financial aid thru their Finacial Assistance Program that gives you reduced price in MCAT fees and free year subscription for MSAR (provides full admission stats for med schools). For your grade, look into post bacc/SMP/master programs!! Each program have their pros and cons, but you pretty much need to prove that you can handle a full academic load AND do well. I'm recent physiology major grad who graduated and currently enrolled at CSULA's academic enhancer post bacc. I'm doing really well and will most likely raise my gpa by 0.2!!! It's ok to take time and get it right, even if you already graduated. Good luck to you and anyone else

People can give constructive advices.... but reality is.... you have little to no chance to get into good med schools with a 3.0 GPA! I am not sure about schools in states like Kentucky or Kansas though . Maybe go for master first! Or post bacc to improve your GPA! Or get into research! Theres also other good paying health professions available such as pa, nursing, dentistry, radiology, etc! Good luck

 I would suggest trying your best to ace the MCAT and applying broadly (may be consider DO schools). They can’t accept you if you don’t apply. So if your dream of becoming a doctor is big enough, you should try your best in subsequent steps and apply! Good luck!

No matter how much you may think your peers have over you, realize that the strangers on the application-evaluation committee (and in the job market) have seen dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of applicants in the past that're better than all of you - and they know from experience that numbers are not people. Sell yourself - in writing and in person. There is more substance to every person than can be notated on an application, and it's your job to show the remaining bits of who you are - and THOSE bits are the ones that will matter most, in the end.

You are going to need to really kill a postgrad program. It is definitely not worth it to apply as is.

Good luck to you :)

I think you should stop this i havent met the one type of mindset. Everyone you meet, in your classes, in your clubs, in your whatever, has the potential to be your friend or best friend. There are some relationships that on paper should've been a match made in heaven for friendship and they should've ended up being each other's best man or bridesmaid. But if you just expect things to fall into place and that friendship to grow then you're wholly mistaken by how friendships are even formed in the first place. There are some friends out there that have nothing in common but still somehow stay friends, because they worked at it, they kept at each other's lives and learned how to be friends with each other.

I think everyone finds friends differently. Perhaps you find a friend by posting to the UCLA Secrets page and friend-ifying commenters? :) *hint hint*

Good luck to your cousin.

Stupid.

Love reacts only please.

Pretty sure OP is talking about the Anime class I'm in. I was so surprised when no one said anything. I guess the last 30 minutes of magical-schoolgirl-in-Feudal-China shojo were enough to crush everyone's spirit lmao.

It would've prevented the John Podesta hack, and thus might've changed the outcome of the election. Need any more to convince you?

Jesus was born in Judea (Western Asia) so he technically was Asian lmfao

What the fuck. 1. This was my party. 2. This was my dildo (that was brand new by the way) 3. I DIDN'T POST THIS SO SOMEONE AT THE PARTY IS PRETENDING TO BE ME.

Is it about his mom though?

is this straight culture

Cuter hotter better and then some. Just tryna help a sister out

Then wait till after graduation. I know that sucks but they can’t exactly take their tuition money back after that.

Im a flaming feminist and Im here for you. This system hurts men and doesn't allow them much emotional release. A feminist who wants to see a better world realizes the pain of everyone. I'm sorry if others have made you feel discounted. There are so many opinions out there these days it's hard for good ones to be heard. I hope others don't discourage you from telling your story. I wish you peace

Statistically, even if this happened ten times, there isn't even a one percent chance a NYU student wouldn't be one of those hit by the car. I wouldn't send out a letter either

Senpai in the streets. Kawaii in the sheets

My advice, ignore all the commenters here who clearly don't have sympathy for victims of abuse and speak to a therapist while doing some serious math on what your expenses and income potential is. Parental abuse and neglect is real and so is the financial decision to give up thousands and thousands of dollars. If they are really abusive, they know that paying for your college puts you in their debt, and paying for it yourself will put you in debt to the bank/government. There isn't one answer for this but I hope you figure out what's best for you.

@NYU Secrets, yo if you could get me into contact with OP so I can buy him/her a laptop, that’d be great. And I’m being 100% serious

One can only wonder what wage gap you're referring to

Hey, can you watch my junk for a minute?

Hope you don’t run into me I’m going as Picklewise Woman.

If you prefer someone who takes pride in their appearance there's really nothing wrong with that. A bit harsh, but it's about the line you draw. Yours is at cargo shorts. Other people's may be at simply showering.

Let’s not overdramatize the situation. Two people don’t want to be your friend anymore. Life goes on. It doesn’t sound like you’re losing anything here. I’m a little doubtful of that sexual assault claim. Why would you comfort someone who just assaulted you?

Don't make yourself double upset for not studying

lol when the acceptance movement has moved past acceptance into the realm of pushing certain sexualities onto others

how is your life over if you got herpes lmao OP are you stupid

The thing is that you can’t actually win in the world of neoliberal identity politics - anything you do or don’t do will be wrong. For this reason, I recommend thinking for yourself and ignoring the obscurantist nonsense that tells you that being a man somehow renders you incapable of doing so. Take a position, argue it, and fight for it. Those who tell you you’re not allowed to, either ignore them or try to get them to say something substantive about the issue. Be open, of course, to having your mind changed, but don’t let yourself be straightjacketed into thinking your identity somehow makes you incapable of thinking critically.

Hi Op. I organize with Jewish Voice for Peace, too. We SO understand what you're experiencing. The mainstream Jewish discourse leaves little room for pro-Palestine Jewish discourse, but that's where we come in! As the Jewish wing of the Palestinian Solidarity Movement, we are inspired by our Judaism to fight for justice in Palestine! Please feel free to reach out to me via private message if you want to talk some more.

and you didnt hear anything upon entering the bathroom despite them being vigorously fucking?

Wow, all the comments on here are stupid. She’s not entitled. She’s cautious because women have to deal with creepy shit from men constantly, so she didn’t go sleep in this random guy’s bed alone just to be safe. If she had slept in the bed and been assaulted by him, the same people would be commenting that she should have been more cautious and slept somewhere else.

Nah, smoking openly in the middle of a busy pedestrian pathway is rude, it’s okay to judge people who do that.

What setting spray do you use, OP

this is NYU. You are in the wrong school

We can't assume OP is a woman. This is NYU and NYC after all.

Geez this is pretty creepy for something that never happened

Me too.

You're not a Sternie asshole, you're just a plain asshole. Stop stereotyping an entire group of students. We are all not the same. Your actions are likely impacting many of your peers negatively and that's not right.

We are here to support you

Never knew you were a trust fund baby

Bruh... they gave EVERYTHING for you and you're scared that they're gonna take too much from YOU?? Like.. what kind of a parent would take everything from their sons? Unless you're telling me that your parents are those types of parents, gtfooh bro...

At least yesterday was world coming out day right? Hahahaha

This is absolutely terrible advice to anyone who has a disability and needs testing services. You should not discourage people from self-advocating and getting the resources and services they need.

Lol make a difference yeah all that profit for shareholders is so important to humanity

An abuser is not always obvious, they can also be manipulative and convincing. Forcing you into sex is a regular move, you should denounce his acts.

I used to think this kind of petty cross-disciplinary roasting was funny but then I graduated and realized literally nobody gives a shit.

love your active role in this page! already you've done more than ben affleck...but we all already knew that

You should show some hospitality and ask her to join. In those religious text she could be a real goddess disguised as a drunk girl.

is this NYU secrets or BYU secrets lmk

This is the kind of thing this page was created for

...Stern isn't that bad

Sounds like you're better off without her. She sounds like a terrible human being at heart and her true colors emerged. I hope you find someone more deserving of your affection

When I was in high school I was really into God and saving myself for marriage (which is odd because gay marriage wasn't even legal yet) and I called myself the celibacy queen

And this is why you shouldn't take classes that involve writing papers.

you can thank the people who voted for rendezvous instead, thus ruining my following weekends in my last year in the dorms, which was 2015. I used to go to feast every weekend for dim sum. had to have rendezvous SAD alternative. I'm still salty about it bc it fucked up the rest of that year's meals for me

I was this girl before. I went through a similar situation and ended up developing anorexia because of losing 20 pounds a few times. In the end I was skin and bones. I survived and learned how to love myself again. I was lucky enough to have friends like you who were always on my side. Just give her time and monitor her once in a while. She can't rely on gossip or on the fact that she got dumped. We all get our hearts broken sometime and we all have to process it, just give her more time.

Is this Sean Fontaine LMAO Janet Chen Valda Han Rebecca Chang Iris Huang Amy Wu

When I was in high school that was my main impression, no one was really close to me or really knew me. College is the best time to find the specific set of weird people who matches you

Your lack of emotion could be due to overuse of stimulants such as adderall, or as you stated, excessive stress. Try to live more experiences and understand the emotions you are going through

no

Whenever I feel sad or super overwhelmed with life, I go to my professor's office hours and somehow he always makes me feel better. This is why I feel like North Campus professors are better than South Campus ones, because they care about both students' learning and wellbeing. Friends are a great support system too, but sometimes if my friend is having a rough week too, I dont want to unburden myself on her. Therefore, I'm so glad to have found a support system in my professors at UCLA. They really make me want to learn and be a better person too.  #uclasecretsprofessors #uclasecretssupport

The fact that she is no longer into hanging with you means that you might need sometime alway from each other to discover more about yourself/herself. Find new circles of friendships and other people who feel like they need to hang

 Wonchan Kim worrrrrrrrrrd smh that Bryson guy singlehandedly abolished feast brunch

me!! i'm 100% down, feel free to message me!
