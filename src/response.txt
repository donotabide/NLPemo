That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

I would say that it is entirely normal to have 'crushes' it's just just important to be aware that we cannot truly have any more than that as someone looking from a distance. Love can only really come from physical interaction and really knowing a person. Sure, we could obsess over them, but that isn't real because we don't actually know the person; they could be vile in reality, and if we base how we feel about them from the projections they make on social media or in the news, then we only get a filtered version of them, one that is unlikely to reveal any of the bad points about them. So, this would probably fall under 'idealisation' in that you see an ideal person, partly because that is all you're allowed to see and partly because that has become what you want to see. I am guessing that you follow them on social media and the like, so a start would be to break the habit of checking in on them, replacing this behaviour with something else more beneficial. Remind yourself that you don't know that person and that it would be far healthier to focus on 'real world' women and working towards meeting and getting to know someone in that way

I could be wrong but it sounds similar to OCD. I have something similar where I constantly say a sentance over and over in my head to the point where I feel I can't breath and I get really upset. It sounds like you are really suffering and I hope you can find a way to accept the songs so that they just play in the background.. not easy thought. My heart goes out to you x

im so sorry you were let down you can trust this forum though i promise please talk about your feelings here it is not good to bottle them up lots of love Lu xxxx

I'm sorry this has happened to you write. It is really hard to recover when you've trusted and opened up to therapists only to be let down in the end. I am in a similar situation with my psychologist. Took me ages to trust him, opened up to him about stuff I've never talked about to anyone else, cried myself through very difficult therapy, only for him to throw it all back in my face. He knows I have trust issues especially when it comes to men, because of my past, and he proved me right. I really don't know how you can move on from this, I'm hoping to meet up with an advocate after I've finished treatment to try and find a way forward. Not the same when the trust has gone though is it? I hope you can sort something out xxxx

Hi. As someone with a lot of anxiety, I completely get how crappy it feels to start a new job. Trying to learn the job duties along with gauging the personalities of all the new people you are working with can be overwhelming. Its possible that your participation was listed as optional, because they didn't want to make you feel pressured to attend a birthday lunch for/with people you don't know very well. At least that's what it sounds like to me. My company did a secret santa type thing in my department and gave me the option not to participate, due to only having been in this job for about four months or so (and I normally work night shifts so I don't have a ton of interaction with my coworkers). That's just my two cents on the situation, I hope it helps!

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

I am so sorry for what you and your family have experienced. I haven't had that type of experience, but I have suffered from PTSD. The more you talk about it, the better. But I would encourage you to speak with a counselor, someone who specializes in trauma. The rest of your life doesn't have to be lived in fear. I believe your story is miraculous. It sounds like God heard you. I believe if you ask Him to help you overcome the trauma, He'll hear you again and answer. I was led to speak to a counselor, and they helped tremendously. Then I continued to attend seminars to learn more about overcoming my past. It's a process, but God is faithful. I've experienced so much healing, and I don't doubt you will as well. Let us know how it goes. We're here with you.

This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

I feel okay. Like John Nash, I accept that my hallucinations are not real. They are not real people. So I can let them disappear in the distance. Do you think you could be projecting your feeings about breaking up with the child's mom onto the boy ?? Transferring your feelings onto a 7 month old baby is truly bad for the child. This is your son and he looks up to you. He is the wellspring of love. Let that love infect your being.  Adjusting to the idea that you are a parent for life, that is a big adjustment. No wonder you can't eat or sleep, this was a surprise for you, not a planned event.

You have been in this position a long time and it will feel shocking to you to be assertive with her. She is being very selfish. Your school work is work enough. When she is verbally abusive to you, you are old enough now to stop pleasing her and tell her instead that you do not deserve to be treated that way. And walk out of the house after you tell her that you do not deserve to be treated that way. Do not do the chores if she verbally abuses you. If you treat me that way, I won't help you at all. You can stand up to her. You are not her little girl anymore. Doing this will feel foreign to you. But she is being very bossy and unkind to a perfect daughter. I tried to get my mother's understanding and approval for years before I realized I wasn't going to get it.

You are a young adult and need your own space, especially with going to med school. You might need to sit down with mom and have a heart to heart talk with her. Explain how difficult med school is and the amount of work required to be successful. She might also need to come to realize that all work and no play is a formula for failure. Remember it is her house and she is doubling as a landlord. It is a difficult situation for both of you.Perhaps you can agree on some things you can do around the house that would be acceptable to both of you. Be firm , loving and prepared when you approach her. Be sure to choose a good time for both of you where you are both relaxed and open to the conversation.

I am so sorry. It must have been devastating for you. So heart breaking. Thinking of you. xxxx I just hope your post here makes at least one person think twice before acting and can save a life.

My brother killed himself a few years ago. I don't keep track of the date. But losing a child is a whole nother level of heartbreak. I know I was devastated when my GF lost our baby at 3 months. But having actually having had known him and loving him for so many years then losing him cannot be easy. Just try and remember the good times you shared.

Hi, you seem to enjoy things like computers and board games. Do you see this as a good thing or a bad thing? I think it is good to spend your free time doing what you enjoy. Even if other people think it's weird. Maybe you can meet people while you play board games at cafes and other public places. If they enjoy it you can talk to them about it. I think people need relationships in order to feel good. Good luck, don't give up.

I'm sorry you've been struggling, I would advise that you go to your GP as soon as possible. If the racing thoughts get too much go to A/E or contact out of hours or 111 if your in the UK. Many mental health conditions have racing thoughts. Are you sleeping? I agree the headache could be from tension/stress. Have you tried any paracetamol did it help? Hope you feel better very soon. Take care

When I had severe headaches, I fixed it by an improved diet, eating less sugar, and drinking more water, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine. A magnesium deficiency can be related to hallucinations and insomnia.

That's beside the point, I need to be here for a number of reasons. I'm just curious about the behaviour

I don't honestly know much about masochism nor how it relates to self harming, or develops from self harming. I know that when a tendency in me arose towards bulimia behavior, I said to myself, "Oh hell no, not another fucking craziness. I have enough craziness with the bipolar. I'm NOT doing bulimia too. No way." And I stopped doing it. So if there isn't a childhood trauma to identify (how could you have PTSD without a trauma ??) it boils down to: Do you want to keep this urge as your little secret or Do you want to nip it in the bud ??

Not sure what to say here too. But I was bullied a lot too. Some stupid guys used to touch my butt- I was that fat girl who had no bf. It was so embarrassing... First step, is to tell someone about it. Talking about it is a huge relief. Since he has other victims, please, you need to tell someone who can do something-like the police. Have you tried therapy? It's a good way to forget about deep fears - 3 years ago a teacher told me to commit suicide, that I wasn't worth it. That made me deeply depressed, more than I was already, and I associate school with bad things, that's why I'm homeschooled, I just couldn't keep going. I've been to therapy. There is improvement, but you just don't forget about something so bad like that. But it helps!If you want, message me. I'm a good listener!

hi ,i will be your friend. im 38 soon and i would love to try and support you. i have BPD ,social phobia ,anxiety ,depression and dependent PD. i know it would only be online but im here if you want me. love Lu xx

I hope we're already friends, I'm here for support whenever you need me. Take care

I have followed you for years and wished to be a friend. I found out you were too guarded. I was going to send a Christmas card but you did not trust me with your address. I know your last friend was the priest and his wife. But it is ok to move on. I hope you finally find someone whom you are comfortable with. It would surely help.

I too have a irrational fear of people i love dying on me even though there is no relevant evidence to suggest i should be worrying. I have found that getting therapy has helped me a lot, helped me to challenge my negative thoughts. Obviously one day there is going to be a need to be worried but right now if i find myself thinking about this thought i tap myself and say no. This brings me back into the present and away from chasing that thought. Have you thought about going to see your doctor and asking for an assessment? Talking really does help, here to listen if you want to talk. Hugs

You don't sound like a narcissist to me. You just sound extremely depressed. Usually we think of depression as a feeling of sadness - but it isn't necessarily. When I am very depressed, I simply become numb and emotionless except for a cold, analytical self-hatred. Hold onto the reasons that you have for not committing suicide. Remember that it is a very final solution, and mental illness can be treated though it is often a long, rocky road. Have you ever seen a psychiatrist? You may have to try different medications for your depression (and bipolar?) Not every medication works for everyone, and you have to find the combination that's right for you. I feel that would be the first step, and from there you may be able to see a therapist and work your way through this. Don't give up, you are a worthwhile person!

I’m so sorry for what you’re experiencing right now. I want to encourage you to seek help and support from your family and friends or consider to join a support group where you can meet face to face. It will help you not to feel isolated and alone. Consult with your doctor regularly, if you think your medications are not working, you can ask for a new prescription. Take good care of yourself, eat healthy diet, have enough sleep and regular exercise. Please don’t try to harm yourself. Don’t give up, you will get better. I will be praying for you.

I've been there many times. The feeling of numbness and guilt are overwhelming. Trust me, we are all narcissistic and it is ok to be so a little bit. I suggest exploring your emotions a bit and not hiding or being afraid of them. I'm glad you are afraid of dying since that is a clear sign that part of your mind still is convincing you to not commit suicide. It seems like you care for your parents but you don't realize the complexity of the emotion. You don't want them to be sad and it is kind of clear that you don't want to bother them. Take some time to reflect and see yourself without labels such as good, bad, parasite, etc. Parents are suppose to be a support and as long as they are willing to do so, let them do it. This inquietude that you feel is a clear sign that you are still tuning your ambitions. Keep looking for things that you love to do.

I've had racing thoughts or feelings before although they are very rare for me. It's weird feeling, like my brain is switching around at high speed.

I don't think this is psychosis. Don't let people give simple diagnosis like that. What you went through is closer to ADHD than anything else. During the day, we go through many emotions and thoughts. It is not clear many times how our brain must order our thoughts, so when they are racing through, chances are that it will be difficult to calm down and explore each one by one. I know that many people take this in the wrong way but have you tried or thought about meditating? It's been helping me a lot since I was a teenager.

Try to meditate and take deep long breaths in moments like this. Let the racing thoughts come and go, they will eventually decelerate.

I’m not entirely unfamiliar with these things You need to get back in touch with your gentle side, the part of yourself that hosts emotions of loving-kindness, empathic joy, compassion, generosity and so on. This can be done through meditation, for me a big breakthrough was to look at our shared suffering and the fact that everybody suffers in different ways. No matter how joyful people look, underneath the surface there is pain and suffering that they are resolutely not looking at, and this can open the doors to your feelings of compassion. Other routes you could look into would be for instance a family constellation group, often these things are connected to what happened to you during childhood. Psychotherapists often offer this therapy type to help people get more in touch with the way they have experienced their parents, siblings and so on. About your anger, I’d be extra careful not to let the easy experience of anger start to dominate your emotional life, it will only make things more difficult for you in the long term.

I can kinda understand what u describe. Growing up I always seemed to have a 'strange' sense of humour. for example Id see a film where someone is getting killed by being run over by a car and lose their legs and find it funny while others found it grotesque. One of the best ones I heard was 'I knew XXX was gay cos hes always so 'nice''. Or 'I hate how all the lads tease XXX just because hes so perfect'. Im far from perfect. Theres nothing wrong with being selfish... just dont hurt others in the process

The feeling of numbness is normal. Not having emotions or feeling like you are faking it through is mostly a manifest of the fact that you are aware of your thoughts. I've been there when I felt like I had no clear direction but the one given by my parents.

Hiya and to the forum. I think your mother has suffered so much that she has learned to put on a hard shell and not feel empathy in case it was dangerous for her. She is totally wrong in her assessment of everything and you are not being stupid AT ALL. You have genuine feelings of pain and need support. I think that sometimes a person who has been through hell themselves (your mother) can't see that their response to that pain affects their children. She has caused you untold damage by her reaction and she won't be able to see it. You don't have a perfect life, you are like the rest of us, have ups and downs and not perfection. i don't think you will be able to get your mother to see sense on this. She sounds as though she has closed her mind. I think you need to get help for yourself first and not minimise your feelings. Some therapy or seeing a doctor might help you. I would first tell you that you are entitled to your feelings and you are in need as much as anyone else on here. Your feelings are valid.

A lot of people don't seem to be able to understand depression. The pain a clinically depressed person can be the same as a person that has had X happen to them. The thing is we can't control it, we are brave strong people that face those feelings every day without giving up. Your mom was so wrong to say those things to you. Facebook always gets me down because people don't respond to my posts. I hope things with your mom work out the way you want them to.

I'm very sorry for your losses xx. Must be very raw for you. I would suggest do try out getting some support, don't give up if the first person you see isn't right, but try again. And then see how you feel in say 6-12 months time? You are understandably full of grief at the moment. It must be hard to see forward at all. But perhaps having time to talk to someone objective could help you to evaluate things better. I can very much relate to feeling entirely hopeless and not wanting to live at all. I hope things can get better for you. xx

Today must have been hugely difficult, especially with the conflict of feelings about the funerals. No wonder you are feeling so low. I'm the odd one out amongst my family. I don't have a partner or friends or a job and can't see any point being here. It doesn't matter. What matters is making sure that you are getting enough support to enable you to think rationally away from huge triggers and stresses like today, and decide on a way forwards in time that is doable for you. If you need more time off work you could discuss this with your GP/employer if that would help...x I wish you well xx

I’m sorry you are feeling like you are worthless and I know – I’ve been there. The reality is you are worth so very much and I hope you can begin to see this. You are uniquely gifted and you have a story to tell and a part to play in your own life and in others’. Many people in your position are not sensitive to how their problems affect others. You care about your husband’s reactions to your situation and that is a hopeful sign – you have not withdrawn into yourself. You are aware of how you feel; ask yourself how this is impacting your behavior, and also what you are doing to change your situation. You need action here. Have you talked to your family doctor? You have a psychiatrist – do you consider them an effective help? If not, try someone else but keep persevering. Have you tried simply a counselor? If you’re on medication, do you stay on track with it? These are all positive things you can do to help yourself. Once you feel you’re moving forward, talk this over with your husband. He loves you and I’m sure is concerned and would be encouraged.

Hi and welcome to the forum! Dont worry about posting here, thats what the forum is for, to vent, to express how you feel, to try and make sense of whats going on. There are people out there that are going to read this and who are going to care so please stick with it and wait to hear what others advise. Hugs

I read every word. First off, there is no problem in this world that can't be made worse by drinking or other substance abuse. You must address that first. There are tons of help available and I know of a wonderful forum for sobriety that if you pm me, I will send that to you. Second, stop and think for a minute about your willingness to take illegitimate substances but stubbornly refuse a prescription which can authentically help you. It's true it may take a few weeks to kick in, but if you don't give it a start will you not be in the same or worse circumstances at the end of those few weeks? Bravo for leaving the terribly abusive Ex, that is horrid business and takes a lot of time and work to heal from. I have, to my dismay, been down that path. It is so confusing at the time. So damaging. Just about everywhere has free domestic violence counseling. Please give them a call asap. You are in dire trouble on several fronts and I am so glad you are reaching out for help and support. I hope you will make some positive decisions and pivotal changes in your life. There is a huge support community to help you through all it.

We are here to listen, and yes I read your entire entry. Please don't think that no one cares because we do! I really feel bad for you because it sounds like you are in a very manipulative relationship and your friendships are not that great either. You are going to people, drugs, sex to numb the pain that you have, but none of that will eventually solve any of your problems. Actually, all of them will make them worse. What you need is some stable, solid people in your lives that truly care about you. Do you have family or friends that truly care, rather than taking advantage of you? if so, stick to those people and slowly put your life back together. if not, have you considered visiting a church or join a group and form some solid friendships?

Shame your cctv doesn't work, I have motion sensors on mine, so they aren't recording all the time. No point them recording nothing! Keep a camera handy, and record dates and times. Problem is of course, from a flying drone you can't prove who's flying it for police purposes. But gettting evidence is a start. This will become a big problem in future, let me tell you.

This may not be a wise move from a legal standpoint, but I would knock it out of the air. You'd surely know who was flying it when they came to collect the wreckage. But then that might instigate a fight. I HATE drones. I read about a guy who shot one down with a shotgun because the neighbor was using it to take pictures of his young daughters in bathing suits near their pool. My brother told me about a nature show he was watching, they had a drone getting close up photos of a chimpanzee or other ape. The ape getting pissed off at it casually picked up a stick and knocked it out of the air smashing it to pieces. I feel the same way about drones as the ape did.

I think it's like everything. New or old. The majority of people use things ok. I have a drone, not flown it yet. but a small percentage ruin it for everyone. If you look up laws, almost every one is because of morons. It's not too dissimilar to locking doors. I hate locking doors, in fact I think I wrote a 20 page chapter on locking doors!

Having an episode of "going fast" turn into depression is so shocking. I have the bipolar and what has happened to you sounds familiar to me. I'm always telling people to analyze their childhood and make sure their depression isn't coming from the past. But sometimes, I think the body just goes into these cycles. I just went through a period of mania/insomnia for five days myself. I am on medication; lithium 450mg and navane 2mg. I did better on 600mg lithium but it made my intestines very sick after 7 years, so we cut it down. It's frustrating for you to have to put your life/plans on HOLD because of this MH interference. I can tell you it usually doesn't last forever because the body chemistry changes. You will get better, but nobody knows WHEN.

Your "fast" episode sounds a lot like classic mania. Everything is driven, sped up, bouncing wildly from one thing to another. Brilliant ideas that you realize later didn't even make sense. Not sleeping. With my Bipolar II diagnosis I don't experience mania quite to the extreme that you're describing - no psychosis etc., only on the lows - and it's called "hypomania." But even with that, I'm all too familiar with that sickening crash. It seems like at a certain point in a manic episode, your mind and body just plain run out of energy. No one can sustain that accelerated pace forever. For me actually it has never lasted longer than two weeks. And then you find yourself teetering on the edge. The smallest thing can trigger it, and before you know it, so rapidly that someone watching you could probably see it happen - you fall out of the sky. I have just recently pulled out of a very long and deep depressive episode that was triggered by my diagnosis and exacerbated by the mood stabilizer they put me on. The dosage, as it turns out, was too high; not only was it knocking off the highs, but it was flattening my mood at a level far below where it should have been. A simple change in dose of the same mood stabilizer, plus a different antidepressant, and I truly feel like a new person. Sadly, like your team told you, it just does take time. Different people respond in different ways to various medications and therapies, and it takes time just to see if a medication is working before trying something else. Most antidepressants, for example, won't take effect until about a month after starting them. In dealing with the fallout from your manic episode, knowledge is power. You can't change what you did, but you can learn and understand why you did it - why your mind was out of control. Strained and broken relationships are the most painful thing, and sometimes they never can be repaired. But as I'm learning, it's so important that you forgive yourself and move on from there. To keep wallowing in mortified guilt isn't going to get you anywhere. It just makes your offense look bigger and bigger in hindsight. Anyway I'm wishing you the best in all this. It's a tough road for sure, and things may get worse before they get better (I hope not!) but they will get better.

Are you sure about that though? I've felt it myself, and I actually took a video of myself on it and jeez was I out of it, I didn't particularly feel it though, but I did feel more 'chatty'. I also worked with someone before that came into work on Diazepam (again for a physical injury) and she was basically on a trip. She didn't realize she was so out of it, but she was, to the point where she ended up getting taken home by one of the managers! It's a powerful drug that masks things very well, hence why I don't agree with its usage in this sense.

i feel so sad you want to become a robot ,so to speak. i have BPD to am full of intense emotions ,although i find it difficult i wouldn't want to be without emotions at all because they are part of who i am do you receive any counselling at the moment? i think that would really help you

you are not alone solitude every time i see cruelty i wish i could be less emotional ie burst into tear you would think with a mother like i had i would have had a thicker skin but alas no our emotions hurt as my voices tell me i am to have a balance and i like you are always analysing how are we to make sense of the world otherwise but not a robot - to look and see but not know

I can relate. When my ex wife left me abruptly and without warning I spiralled out of control and turned to the bottle for comfort. I drank copious amounts of alcohol and took lots of street drugs. That's no place you want to be believe me. Its natural to want to feel nothing. But I think you could work thru some of these things in therapy. Its clichè but time does heal all wounds. Keep posting here though. Its good to get it out. Take care.

For me, i remember once a family member having a go at me about my room and because i already had mental health problems as well as attempts on my life, this incident again brought up strong emotions and thoughts about running away and perhaps suicide. But in the end i decided to leave it be and then the next day i was glad that i didn't act on anything. This was important because it showed me that i don't need or have to listen to my emotions, thoughts, etc. I can wait and see it out. I can use that as a tool for if it ever happens again. Please don't listen to those feelings and thoughts, they are completely wrong. Once you see it out, i hope this also allows you to see that you shouldn't act on these things and that there is light.

I think it's a good thing to come here whenever you want to. This isn't the best place for advice compared to GPs, but it's much better for emotional support. I think that it's important to know that this is a long rollercoaster, with lots of ups and downs. Keep going, as it's a marathon, not a sprint. Have you seen a GP?x

Sorry you are feeling so bad. I just try and get through each hour, each minute. Breaking down time rather than seeing it as endless. Sometimes I stay in bed so I can't act on the thoughts. Distract. With regard to therapy, it can make you feel worse before you feel better because of bringing things to the surface that may have been buried in your head for a long time. Talking can be very painful but hopefully if you can get through it things will get better

You've done the right thing. It will be confidential. There will be an investigation. Don't doubt yourself, they will decide what the next steps are for the well being of the child, that isn't your responsibility. Imagine if no one had said anything and something had happened to the little boy? Hope you can look after yourself xx

the thing with neighbor problems especially if there are lots of other neighbors close by, they really cant be sure. i mean the folk opposite could have complained. i have been in a situation where i complained about a neighbour who was a hazard to themselves and others. and the person did actually say to me it was you wasnt it and i denied it. as i had nothing to loose and they would never be sure. like you i couldnt cope with the situation and needed to bring it to an end as no one else who lived in the neighborhood was going to do it. and really they need to be careful as if they are doing drugs they need to keep a fairly low profile and any possibilty of keeping their little boy is at stake. so the odds are stacked against them. maybe might be a good idea to report them for drug use to the police while you are about it. as then the police can keep an eye on it. and maybe take action in the future again you can remain anonymous

You have absolutely done the right thing here. There should be more people like you in the world. Please don't beat yourself up about it. I think that I would have done the same as you. x

Mental illness has no prejudice and can affect anyone. It's just that an illness. I attempted suicide 2 years ago, and thankfully regretted it and called 911 to save myself. I still have thoughts of suicide, but last month my step father committed suicide and after dealing with the loss, unanswered questions and witnessing what this has done to my mother I just can not ever do it no matter what thoughts I have. When I attempted one of my daughters was home and since my step dad did it all I can think of is how I made my daughter feel that day, and when the thoughts come instantly I see her face and I am so thankful. You are not lame for writing on this forum, you are brave and a lot stronger than you think. It doesn't seem like your meds are working. Maybe tell your doc that you don't think they are working, your having irrational thoughts, or something like that. I know you don't want to probably say suicidal thoughts because then they will put you in the hospital, so just think of a clever way to say that. Also, are you anxiety, depression, bipolar?

I'm sorry you're feeling so terrible Imhotep That's such a hard place to be, when you're having suicidal thoughts, and everything seems hopeless. It's not lame at all to write about this here. Many people will relate to the place you find yourself in, many of us have been there too. I hope expressing here how you feel, and reaching out to others who might understand, will help a little. I'm glad you've posted what you did, it's better than keeping it to yourself, and struggling alone. If you feel in danger of acting on your suicidal thoughts please have a look at our page on getting help. It tells you who to contact if you need emergency medical help, plus other sources of support if you feel in crisis. There is also this article by one of our staff members on feeling suicidal that may be helpful to read. I hope things improve for you Imhotep. Do you have any support at the moment, anyone you can talk to? Please don't feel you have failed, you are at a really difficult time in your life, but that doesn't mean you are a failure. Try not to compare yourself to others, in my experience it has only made me feel worse about myself. And it's not comparing like with like. You are trying (and have tried hard in the past with different approaches) to find a way out, a way for things to feel better. I know it's hard, but please keep trying. Something will help, if you can find the right thing for you. I hope your anxiety lessens enough to let you get some sleep. Take care.

You definitely are NOT lame for writing on this forum. You are asking for help and therefore are alot stronger than you believe. Have you spoken to your doctor about the meds not working? Perhaps this would be a good idea to do so. Also, it couldn't hurt to explain to him, in person verbally...or on paper if it is easier for of the negative thoughts you are having. If you do not think he is listening to you, there are other doctors.

I would complain to the Council. For your own mental health. What she is doing totally disrespects her neighbors. Don't worry about protecting her. You may be doing her a favor. Bad behavior does not deserve to be rewarded.

Wow, that's rough. I'm sorry. I've had difficult neighbors as well. I know that you are afraid to talk to her about the yelling, but have you tried coming to her as a friend and asking if she's okay? Maybe if you approached the situation from a position of wanting to help her, she'd be more willing to listen. She, probably, feels alone and afraid--especially if she has some kind of mental disorder. Most of the time, people just need someone to listen. I bet she does. Kindness disarms people.

If she knows that you also have mental health difficulties it would certainly be worth a shot approaching her about it, explaining that what she's doing is effecting you in a detrimental way, but also drawing attention to what she's actually doing, as she may not realise that it is so 'bad'.

My Gran has Alzheimer's and she has been in an over 65s psychiatric hospital but in the next few weeks she's moving to a nursing home (one we chose after much searching). It is quite distressing because it is like you're losing that person and suffering grief even though they are alive, because they are not the strong personality they once were.

Have you read my intro in the front page? I only mention it as you can look out for the Home doing good care for your gran. It is sad to be the relative of someone living with dementia, but in knowing a little of what you can do and better understand, can be helpful, I hope.

I cared for my grandmother for a number of years till she passed, but I always promised her that she wouldn't be sent away, as she was terrified of hospital and....my mother (her daughter). I took on her care, after I found that my mother had taken my nans dog to be put down as she (my mother) didn't like cleaning up after it.... not that my mother saw her much. My Nan cared for me as a child and was the buffer between me and my mother (along with my granddad). She was a lovely woman, who towards the end, constantly asked what day it was, tipped her plate of food down the back of the kitchen radiator, and insisted that my father had stolen my grandfathers work tools. Never aggressive, often bewildered, but always grateful if you sat and held her hand. I miss her also

I would think that hyperventilation would be associated at most times with anxiety but I could be wrong. I breathe very shallow most of the time so I don't have your experience. The one who knows best what you are feeling is you. If you are having the hyperventilation but no anxiety, are you thinking the anxiety is hidden under the breathing ??

I am thinking that anxiety can be related to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress and anxiety We can have chronic metabolic acidosis, which includes anxiety due to hypoxia as one of its symptoms. Increased breathing compensates for the acidity by decreasing carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Panic attacks may indicate a problem with pH, which is compensated for by hyperventilation. Over compensation can result in alkalosis. I think this can be caused by a chronic poor diet, such as a typical western diet. Eating nutrient rich foods helped me lose my anxiety, as well as avoiding caffeine, sugar, sodas. Antioxidants, such as lemon juice, may be helping also. A Magnesium deficiency can also related to anxiety (and depression, insomnia), and I am trying to keep topped up with epsom salt baths. What you are describing sounds quite like Kussmaul breathing a symptom of severe metabolic acidosis.

I do have anxiety and it is pretty severe. What is confusing me is that they say anxiety attacks bring about hyperventilation and many other symptoms I show and I rarely get those attacks, I avoid most situations. This is how I can explain the confusion at my best. There are those times when people have panic attacks and they show signs like hyperventilation. I do have anxiety and I always experience hyperventilation, not only at the time of a panic attack. Is hyperventilation bound to those times one experiences panic attacks?

These must make life very difficult. Some kind of therapy may be helpful. Have you consulted anyone about these issues

Can someone suggest a solution. I suffer from physicos because past flat share mates kept on coming in my private dwelling while I was sleeping moving things around, stealing items, vandalising fixture and fittings, even hacked into the wi fi. The offenses have been petty and vile to the point, I hate being around strangers, odd surroundings,. Do you think I ll get better or is this how things are going to remain.

Using your body during the day will help you be tired and ready to sleep at night,walking or sports,swimming going to the gym.Don't watch telly too late,have your bedroom warm and airy,drink some hot drink before bed,read a little before you try to sleep.Nytol and other over the counter remedies may help they are better than drugs off the doctor.Getting your anxiety levels down try to switch off the worry at bedtime,don't think about things, empty your mind,you can try mindfulness practise and deep breathing exercises.Google it, deep breathing to aid sleep.Good luck with this.

I have similar issues with insomnia. It was actually caused by me taking a sedative for to long. I haven't found anything to be successful. I sleep about as well on the antipsychotic/sedative that I am as I did before. The difference is that I know can't sleep with out it.

It's very serious, yes. But It's possible to resolve the problem. Health emotional surrounding, physical exercises and meditation should do the treatment. But the trick is you should be persistent and do it every single day. Another effective way is hypnosis. There're audio podcasts on the web. Ny favorite is this one Sleep Hypnopill - Best Self Hypnosis Audio for Insomnia, Deep Sleep Hypnotherapy

You don't trust him. That's not a good early sign for sure. Here's my two cents: Coming from someone who's been married and separated in that marriage, the best advice I've ever gotten is to never make any major decision regarding your relationship really fast or out of an emotional place. If you were already married, I'd say take sixmonths to a year before deciding to leave or stay. You are engaged, still a major commitment but with less weight. Maybe we'll say 3 months. Why? Because we tend to make the wisest decisions when we have time to think and let our emotions settle. You love him but don't trust him. You will need time to communicate and work on that in order to decide whether a marriage will work or not. If you need to postpone the wedding, by all means, postpone it. That may be a good time to tie in the conversation you'll have with him about trust. Avoid accusing him and use I statements." I'm struggling to trust you here. I'm reevaluating our relationship but I'd like to make it work,." Etc Whatever you do, do not just freak out and leave and call it off in one day. Do not make a decision out of hurt and being upset because you won't be truly ready to move on. It is good to stay with the one you love--- if after a time of careful consideration, you are confident you can be a team and face struggles together. Also, sex does not keep a marriage. If he loves you, he will be faithful. If he's unfaithful and loving it, no amount of sex can make him true to you. That being said, consider if there's something he's not getting from you that can be easily adjusted. Something like the level of respect you treat him with. A lot of men thrive off our respect in a relationship. Ive said a lot. Hope things work out.

I'm sorry that this is such a difficult situation. Have you considered a seeing a relationship counselor? Even if your fiancé won't go, it will be helpful to discern which direction you should take with your relationship. You deserve to have peace of mind.

I've been married for 16 years. I can tell you it doesn't get easier. Having kids makes it harder. Divorce hurts kids. I'd advise being sure everything is healthy before you tie the knot. I watch porn a lot as a coping mechanism and I hide it from my wife. Sex with her is good. Even if we're having sex regularly I still watch it. It hurts her when she finds it but I rely on it to self sooth. I know it's not healthy and I know I should build real relationships.

It's difficult when it comes from family isn't IT the people who are supposed to love us. I've learned to stop looking for what I need/ needed from theese people. It's not you Its them.

Your story is not unusual. A lot of people who post complain about dis-interested and toxic family members. My experience is similar. A lot of people are just brainwashed and don't think. You need to think independently to break through the mainstream thought process. It is a step too far for some people who are just on autopilot. A lot are obsessed with money or power, or just their own little bubble. In reality, few people really care or understand. Work towards your strengths, keep grounded and lucid, and treat your toxic family with caution and contempt.

Wondering if any of your family members have had any trauma in the past. My step dad beat my mom when we were kids (he was also abused and is a combat vet). All us kids are dealing with how we processed this and other traumas to this day, yet if you ask her she will say "that was in the past" and doesn't understand why my brother doesn't come around.

1) It's absolutely perfectly ok and normal to not be sure at times or even most or all the time. 2) Yes it's normal to be honest and say you are not sure but also it's best to say you are not sure if you really are not sure. Imagine this situation: An athlete call Bob hasn't had much training and has been eating junk food, and his trainer asks if he wants to participate in an up coming race. Bob now has two choices, be honest with his trainer or lie and say he is ready. So what you did it's correct. It's always best to be honest. 3) Yea i would say it;s normal to disagree with your family/siblings/parents about principals, philosophies, in regards to life. I'm different to both my parents in my life view and principals. Some people are similar to their parents, but others are not. 4) Just know that you have not done anything wrong and that you should be proud that you have a great quality in being honest. You know yourself best. And hopefully then you can put this behind you. And also know that you can always ask on this forum for an opinion or to vent about life. We are not judgemental here and we will always support one another.

I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one

I have found that my parents will say things thinking that they are being helpful but they have no idea how their words aren't helping. I think this is mostly because they are looking at the situation through their own experiences. I still confide in them sometimes but I don't take them very seriously. The only person who has helped me figure things out is my therapist.

It's often because the parents are powerful and schools don't want to run the risk of making such powerful enemies. That only fuels their power rush though as they think they're invincible. On the other side of the spectrum though and much like what you said about how they need counselling, if they're having problems at home that are causing this bullying nature the school doesn't want to get involved.

I agree that the victim shouldn't have to move to get away from bullying. That should be a last resort if all over measures have failed.

You may already have done so but I think is a good idea to get any symptoms checked out to ensure there is nothing physical behind them. Therapy such as cbt can sometimes help to cope with symptoms of health anxiety.

Glad you have had it checked out. Hope you get the cbt again soon xxx

I completely understand how you feel. i have such bad health anxiety that any little ache or twinge sets me off. i agree get yourself checked out for ease of mind more than anything. The only problem i have atm is sometimes i find it extremely difficult to come away from these physical symptoms such as i get currently severe shakes to the point my body wont relax. It makes me stress out more. i wish you all the best in your battle. take every day as it is. Things will get better.

Germaphobia is a tough mental issue to overcome but you have been given this task or developed this problem and you definitely have taken the right first step opening up and talking about it here on this forum. I have a friend in the hospital with cancer and he also has an open sore on his leg. They said it might be Mrsa and bandaged it. I was freaking out that they let me just go in his hospital room without gloves and precautions. They never told me and I just went in there to visit. I was upset for quite awhile but had to let it go. It's hard to let it go.

I use to take neurontin and it not only made my hair fall out in clumps, it turned my very curly hair into straight hair. Now I'm having blurry vision from lithium. Before this I had severe GI distress from the lithium, so we cut the dosage down quite a bit. All the drugs have side effects. It's like I have a bad marriage to psychiatry; until death do us part.

Ablify is at least one I know of that makes hair fall out. It made my hair fall out in clumps and bits and no one believed me. It was horrible. So, yeah some medications can cause hair loss. Talk to your doctor about it. If it is the medication it will grow back after stopping it.

I have been suffering from hair loss for like 6 months as I had bariatric surgery. I lost like half of my hair, but today my boss told me of injections of B12 that helped her with the hair loss. Maybe it's something you could ask about your doctor?

I'm so very sorry for all that your going thru. Sorry for your loss, glad your receiving treatment and having therapy. The bullying will have damaged your self confidence, please don't be sorry and don't blame yourself. You really should report, I can understand your fears. Can you find another job? You shouldn't have too however you will probably be happier. Here to listen. Take care

Here a couple of things I'd say to offer some support (although I am by no means a licensed professional): 1. Structure - You noted to us that whenever you're alone, your anxiety and depression get the best of you. I'm the same way (minus the depression), because my OCD makes me obsess a lot over little things. In general, I would recommend structure. Get out more often, find things to fill your time with—that are healthy—and do your best to lead a productive life. 2. Finding a Job - Finding a job sounds like it will be essential to your recovery path. What I would recommend is asking your clinical supports (e.g counselor) if there are any rehab programs that help mentally ill people find employment. In my state of Massachusetts, we have an organization called MRC that does just that. My hope is that those options will be made available to you. However, I would also say to take it easy. While money is a present problem for you, putting too much pressure on yourself over finding a job while you're already on a bumpy road will exacerbate your symptoms. You want to ensure you're stable going into a job. 3. Coping Skills - Coping skills are also imperative to your overall mental health. Everyone needs them. When you have moments of self-doubt, ask yourself some questions: "What makes this not my fault?" "What can I do to help myself?" Something else that will help is giving yourself self-soothing. Coloring, writing, drawing, listening to music, meditation, and exercise are all healthy examples of coping mechanisms that are recommended by clinical professionals. They keep us feeling strong and help us keep our minds in the right place. 4. Give Yourself a Break - You're not to blame for everything. It really is unfortunate that you've lost so many people, and I'm very sorry that all of these difficulties are piling up on your shoulders, but there is a lot of hope still in store for you. You have to be easy on yourself, and recognize that we're only human. Pace your recovery and make sure your counselor is aware of how you feel. If you need any further encouragement or support, let me know!

I would just like to thank you all for the very thoughtful comments already received. It truly means the world to me. Keeping everything to myself for so long and finally releasing it all on here, then to receive such heartwarming replies in such a short space of time has blown my mind. Excellent advice too which I will definitely follow. For the first time in months and months I feel like I am not alone.

It's so old school to say stressful situations are character building. A Little Support would be character building. There will be more of this character building if you go into the forces.

Depending on how much longer you have, If you are stuck in the situation and need to finish school, I would stick with it until it is done and move on. If it is a longer term situation, I would find whoever is in charge (not the immediate supervisor that you have talked to but the one who is above) and explain the situation. You should not have to be forced into gossiping and talking about things that has nothing to do with work, that is abuse, and you should not have to participate in that. So if it is short term, bear with it for a few months. but any longer talk to the one above your supervisor. If it gets to the point where you have to seek medical attention to your anxiety , that is way too much.

I’d also look into why exactly this is causing you stress... being asked to sit with workmates, teambuilding lunches, it doesn’t sound like it should be causing stress. Similarly it’s kind of normal to be open to a certain extent when with others. So if this is causing you stress, perhaps there is some other underlying cause? What Poopy Doll said about the forces is also probably right, that the kind of attitudes towards “building character” there are even more old school then at other institutions. It’s worth thinking about what you are letting yourself in for...

No not really being suicidal isn't part of psychosis.Psychosis means you have lost touch with reality in some way,in that you might not know you are on earth or alive or conscious of your surroundings,you may be delusional and living a different reality...like you may think you are on a different planet and everyone around you are aliens in human form,you might not know what day or time it is and may take off and live rough for days until help finds you.Psychotic depression can include very low mood and suicidal feelings though but it isn't usually a major factor in psychosis.Does that help and make sense?

That does make more sense. But can a person be in such a low mood they kind of lose touch perhaps not with reality but with themselves??

ok best i can advise is i suffer from Psychosis and major depression at a very low time can have the same affects in some cases if you so low yes u can totaly lose reality and become a prisoner with in yourself but also this can happen but you seem to carry on as normal with day to day life but this major depressive feeling is deep with in yourself which is a worry as everybody around u sees u as normal this mental injury doesent have plasters or a bandage to show you are ill or hurt ive suffered so long i mask it well my family cant tell my state of mind 80% of the time which is bad you need to open up as much as possible and try not to totaly hide it so this way you dont become a prisoner with in your own mind/body i have a 5yr post on this site all the good and bad and still running today may be worth a read i hope u manage to fine the piece with in yourself and find your way to cope with this all the best mark

Opening up is hard. I hate feeling weak. That's how I feel about my life too. No job, no school, no friends, no drivers license, can't even exercise anymore besides painful short walks. It really licks! Do you have any passions or hobbies you might do?

I am no expert, but I often think most people are pretending a lot of the time. If you look on Facebook, most people will post photos of themselves eating in restaurants, on holiday, smiling, but in reality their life isn't like that everyday. They don't mention the negative things in their life. If you went around taking photos of everyone going about their day to day business, I bet most people would not be smiling. I feel like if I am not ok, I have to pretend I am ok. Even when I am extremely stressed and upset, people don't notice (except for very close family members).

I tend to focus inwards: Imagine better times. Make plans. Do something I enjoy. Visit some one I like. Basically I look after myself. Your relationship with your self is the most important you'll ever have.

You are still quite young and have time on your side. You have time to have experiences that will change you. You have time to challenge your Core Beliefs. You can identify your Core Beliefs and learn to let them go. One such belief might be, "I am a bad person" or "No one can love me" or "I am a failure and disappointment". I had the core belief that "I do not deserve to BE" and spent years getting rid of this notion. These are just ideas we are carrying around with us. They are not FACTS.

Loneliness, sadness, anger come from your post? Maybe pushing out feelings that are hard to manage and focusing them on other people? Don't know, sorry. Is Ok to feel these things to an extent but obviously they are causing you problems otherwise you wouldn't be here? x

Anger is one of those emotions that usually manifests first or last when under distress, certainly from experience. Anger leads to jealousy. Jealousy leads to hatred. Hatred leads to loneliness. If you can best your anger life will become easier, I do not mean that anger should be completely abolished, some of the emotions that you displayed in this post were reasonable, which doesn't make you a bad person does it?

I’m so sorry to hear you are experiencing all of this, it sounds like an awful lot to have to cope with. Having your friends walk away and try to ignore you by putting their headphones in must be a very difficult thing to have happen, especially at a time when you need support. I think you have been very strong and brave sharing this with the forum, being so open is very hard for a lot of people but you have found the strength to reach out. Do you have much support at home? How are you feeling now?

I was diagnosed with psychotic episodes around the age 24 - I was also prescribed anti depressants, and i feel my diagnosis was closer to psychotic depression. My depression started in my late teens. The depression did lift but the psychotic features remained - i am still psychotic 18 years later.

I got diagnosed with depression first.. At around 20.. i was well suicidal and did allot of hard core self harm... I've been on meds ever since.. 27 years of junk... They changed my diagnosis all the time when i was younger.. They almost put me on lithium at one point.. Then they thought i was schizophrenic for a while.. Basically I've been on meds my entire adult life.

I've had depression when I was about 35, but it lifted before I had my first psychosis age 39. They diagnosed me psychosis nos but it could have been something else too. Over the years the voices have disappeared with medication and I'm more or less functioning normally six years later. Diagnosis unchanged. Never had anti depressants. I still take a moderate dose of Orap, an antipsychotic. I used to take Risperdal, which I once weaned off of but too early and I relapsed within six months. I've had about three attempts to wean off the orap, the last over a year ago, all of which ended in severe insomnia and some semi-psychotic symptoms.

crazy my voices tell me the world in which we live in is not real it sets us challenges if we meet them which i would say is inevitable i mean how can u not it strengthens our resolve life is never long enough after all it is not forevever so try i know what it is like i have them myself they are naughty and nice a balancing act as it were a bit like theresa and boris over here you are strong sometimes it is hard to remember what we have achieved in the past think good thoughts my friend never forget we are all special and do not deserve a early close live life to the full

i know there is nothing wrong with planning ahead - considerate of you but dont you think you are giving them what they want this is your life yes i know it is up to you. I once asked something on the board a long while ago before the voices why do we live it said to feel to see to hear in other words to use all our senses and experience life being on the other side will be boring u know that why do you think there is reincarnation we have free will our choices can change other peoples lives - i love your posts some are quite amusing you strike me as a confident person there are others that go through exactly what me and you have be strong

there is not way it would be mostly healed by Monday! I hope you manage not to harm yourself. stick it out till you get your benefits. it seems like a right nightmare over there.

What are you struggling with ? Maybe if we can fix that you won't need to self harm

I like to see the aftermath. I have no support atm either so really struggling with low mood, voices, visions, organising, making decissions and staying safe

If you go to the hospital and they treat you they will contact a shrink about you.. And maybe they can sort out some support for you... Start the ball rolling kind of thing

I've been put on metroazapine or something like that for now and they have fastracked my psychologist appointment

Ah yes that's what I'm on. Was originally going on something different until I pipe up about my sleeping

It's just not right that they won't take you seriously until you actually go to that extent. I really hope your meds and psychologist help. Please stay in touch here.

self harm is addictive and doesn't work for long unfortunately. It is something to avoid getting into the habit of if you can. I have bipolar 2 as well and know how difficult it is to cope with at times. CAn you manage to just live in the moment and not look back or forward in that moment and live through it. Otherwise I am glad you found the forum a place to just talk and explore your feelings. Hold on in there and know that you can make it through this and you are in the best place to do this. My thoughts are with you.

I have got a couple of tips from another forum to distract my self as well as being a spiritualist so am well into meditation.

GREAT that you are into meditation. I hope its helpful. We have a piece on distraction in the top of the forum area. Take care

How long has she been self-harming do you think/know? Very disturbing news for you I can imagine. The part about getting involved with 'bad crowd' could really mean anything without more info (not that suggesting you should post it by the way!) - what sort of bad crowd?

So sorry, this is very hard for parents. We love our children unconditionally and deeply...and it hurts us to see them hurt themselves. It is good that she is seeing a psychologist. Perhaps you and your husband want to consider seeing a therapist together to talk about how to handle the specific issues that are coming up. You still want to parent your child and that may require discipline to continue to form her into a responsible adult. It might help to get support in the best approach to doing this. There may also be parent support groups for parents dealing with these issues. She is only fifteen, it is understandable that you are concerned about who she is socializing with. Kids at this age can be very persuaded and influenced. You and your husband need support right now. This may also lead to family counseling where the three of you can openly discuss issues and perhaps understand the needs of each other. You are the parents, it is wise not to ignore the signs that something is not right or that your daughter might be making poor choices. If you belong to a church, perhaps you can speak to the pastor. You love her and want the best for her. Children at 15 are not able to know what is best. I hope you can find the resources you need to get through this. Stay strong!

To try answer your questions, unsure why the police would be involved but if they were and had concerns for your safety they may ask for a mh assessment. It would depend on circumstances whether you would be sectioned. It isn't a crime to (try to) take your life, again would depend on what had happened, circumstances, as to whether police would interview. Sounds as though you are ready to /need to ask for help if you are thinking about suicide and also about surviving an attempt. You can go to A+E and ask for assessment or call crisis team number to talk to them? I understand feeling desperate and suicidal, am there myself. But think there is hope for you if you are thinking about what if you survive, you can seek help, hope you do x

I guess that depends on how you're planning on doing it - and please don't write specifics here as you're not allowed to. If someone calls the police / ambos because they can see that you're about to do something, then they will try and talk you down. They're not going to stand by and let you do something to yourself (and potentially other people). If they talk you down, then you'll be taken to hosptial (I would guess) and assessed from there.

you'd likely be sectioned for a failed public suicide attempt, assuming sectioned means sent to a psych ward.

It sounds to me that you are doing as much as you can to support your daughter. She will need to build up trust with you little by little. Asking for help when you Self harm is a frightening thing. There is such a stigma around it. She also may feel that she doesn't want to burden you, that she has failed you in some way, that she is unworthy of help and support. Self harm is a way of release, of stress, of mental pain that she is feeling. I can completely understand that this bullying is the trigger for it. Its such a cruel world we live in and kids can be the cruellest picking on the vulnerable ones amongst them. Talking really does help so if you can get her some professional help in that area that should help her deal with the need to self harm.

I don't think removing her from the bullying environment is such a good idea. What happens when she has to enter the real world. She can't hide from everything. I suggest getting her to a therapist who can help her to develop coping strategies to deal with the bullying and whatever else is going on with her at school. Also, I don't know your level of schooling yourself, but if she wants to get into college, I am not sure that homeschooling is a proper amount of credit to get her enrolled. I don't know, but that is something you might want to look into. Often times, people look to solve the problem right in front of them instead of looking for a long term solution.

I think it was a good idea to remove her from the bullying, she will hopefully be stronger when she works. The self harm has become a coping mechanism, she will learn how to cope with a non-violent means. You doing everything you can, maybe when she's older she might like to join the forum. You sound like a very caring parent, please do let us know how she's doing.

I agree go to the police, I'm sorry this was done to you. Visit your GP as a short course of medication might help, you may need counselling as well. I hope you feel better soon. I'm here to listen anytime.

I have all the evidence but I feel like the poster won't be punished and will run free and continue to do worse, like send the photos to my parents. I feel like the police cannot help me remove all the links that come up on google when my name is searched.

It's not too late. You have nothing to be ashamed of, go to the police, revenge porn is treated in the same way as sexual assault because of the devastating consequences to its victim's. Be brave and be strong. This man will be punished. You have done nothing wrong.

I wanted to add that self-punishment could also be negative reinforcement. So, would that change your view on it? Calling it negative reinforcement to stop yourself from giving in to a bad habit, for example?

Some schools of thought believe in negative reinforcement. Some people keep a rubber band around their wrist and snap themselves when they say a swear word, have the urge to use a substance, think of binge eating, etc. So long as its only as obtrusive as a snap from a rubberband I don't see it as harmful, but if you need a bandage after then that is harmful.

Are you the person to whom you refer ?? You show good insight to know the stalking is inappropriate

i also tend to feel my emptiness by buying something. I can't stop it no matter how seriously it makes me have financial problems. That's my life and I know I'm stupid.

I wish I could say something to help you but I have the opposite problem, I can't spend money. I'm just sooo obsessed with saving it up.

I also have a problem with spending. I buy too many clothes, craft supplies, food. Sometimes it's fun, there's a bit of a high that I get when I buy something that's not a pure necessity, but then I feel anxious again about having spent so much money. There are 2 places where I shop that have a rewards program, and I always get promotions in emails for points on food and various other items, some of which are necessities, and others, not so much. I'm going to have to reign in my spending now, because I am jobless and back in university for another year.

I used worry what people thought of me, And didn't like speaking in public, I also don't like how i sound, And kept myself to myself, But, People would make stories up about me, Stuff i haven't done, So, I turned it around, I started speaking out, I went out of my way to know people, I learnt not to worry about what people thought, I made people know me, If they didn't like me, Its not my problem. Start small, Then keep pushing yourself, Only you know when you are ready. don't let fear control you, Remove the fear.

I’m alone too - a widow - and find travelling and socialising especially hard. I am learning to cope and can now travel around by train and across London without any help. I do still get nervous but have decided to keep going anyway as I can have panic attacks just in the house when I am not under any pressure. The trick in my case has been to write down every single aspect of the journey before hand. Time I need to leave the house, time of bus, time of train, carriage and seat number. VERY precise directions about each stage of the journey - get off train, turn left to ticket barrier, turn left to station exit etc. And I tick off each stage when it is managed. It is more a case of managing the fear rather than overcoming it. And it can go wrong. On my last trip the train station was having some reconstruction work done and I ended up at an exit I didn’t recognise - in the dark!!!! Happened over a week ago and I am only just recovering. The other thing that helps, if you have a mobile phone, have some support back up from an understanding friend or relative who can talk you through the situation if things do come totally unstuck.

I can relate rather well to this because me and my brother are pretty similar. I do not think you specified the root to your anxiety but Anyway assuming we're on the same page one thing you can possibly change is your perspective on things, try remember that your situation is their situation, in other words do you care/judge others when you go out? no and some people that you see are probably somewhat socially awkward themselves. Remember other people aren't out there to judge you they're busy doing their own thing. Relax and have fun.

I have no real idea about clothing material but i do know that i don't like big heavy jumpers.

When I was a kid I once had to wear some really itchy trousers. It was horrible. We did a day trip to France that day. In the end, I think i got some pyjamas to wear underneath, but it was still itchy.

Any jumpers irritate me a little, same with woollen hats, and scarves. When I was a kid, the feeling of having hair down my back after a haircut made me so upset I'd have to have my hair cut at home so I could instantly go into the shower, and I'd refuse to wear the shirt I got my hair cut in no matter how many times it was washed. Nowadays I'm much better about that, but it's still a bit annoying to me.

Do you have limited interests? With the interests you do have, are you able to have immense focus for abnormally long periods of time, and master your interests at high level? Do you have a strict schedule you have to stick to, and feel out of sorts if your unable to? Are you awkward socially, or have to mask emotions or personality to fit norms? These are some of the most common characteristics of having ASD. If you can relate to these, then you most likely have it.

My ex-boyfriend has Asperger's. He is highly intelligent, focused and methodical, with an odd, very dry sense of humour. He's quiet and awkward around people and often talked about not being able to show emotion like he thought was proper. Like me, social situations make him anxious. He has often been depressed and irritable but I don't recall any sudden mood swings.

I have lived with someone diagnosed with aspergers and someone else with BPD and I can only say those two people were entirely dissimilar and their particular problems did not 'overlap' in any way. I think you need to do more research. These two conditions are not similar at all.

it must be difficult to be patronised and not treated like the adult you are. i don't have autism but i have had MH issues since before i was a teenager and because i am unable to live a fully independent life i find i get patronised somewhat to it really isn't fair to you and must be so frustrating ,the most important thing though is that YOU know you are an adult and YOU know what you are capable of

As a fellow sufferer of Aspergers, I understand how you feel. I think it's important to be around people that support you, rather than belittle everything you do. Perhaps they don't know they are doing it though, so it's worth talking to them about what they do and how it makes you feel. Keep doing what you love - I'm sure you're great at writing plays and literature!x

Definitely be around people who will support and help you - that's a must. Problem is, for many of us, we don't even know what the issues are, or what the hell is going on, and why things go wrong, for many, many years, even our whole lives in some cases. I'm pushing 50, and have only just been diagnosed. There are those who will quite happily use your weaknesses against you - and you don't even know they are doing it at the time. It's later. A lifetime later in some cases. Well, fuck that

I've had a schizophrenia diagnosis, but have recently been tested for, and diagnosed with, ASD, and have been offered a Life Coach with the adult service The tests are very thorough, and are in three stages. It's well worth going down that path, and it makes a lot of sense, and starts to answer many puzzles, niggles and questions you've had about life, fitting-in, what's going wrong etc, once you get into it. Chase that doctor up, and see what comes of it

i think you have empathy. although we haven't talked much on a one to one. you have helped me before and showed a lot of empathy. you probably don't remember but i do ,a few years ago i posted about abuse. and another time thinking i was a monster ,and you were really kind and supportive

I have a relative who gets very involved with fictional characters' emotions in books, films, will go into a lot of detail re what has happened to them and why and how awful it is if they are struggling in anyway. But they struggle to recognise the feelings and situations of people around them in real life or show compassion. I don't know if being able to empathise with fictional characters/a fictional world is somehow "safer"? I think this is still a form of empathy but at a distance some how. Don't know, just my thoughts, experience. Am flooded with far too much empathy, it doesn't help anyone really and hurts a lot

I hate eye contact but know it is expected, especially if you're asking for help. I look disgusting and want to avoid seeing the judgement in other peoples eyes. One thing that kinda worked was wearing some clear lens glasses instead of my proper ones. I am short sighted and thus those clear lens ones give me the comfort of the psychological barrier betwixt me and them AND since I cant make out their facial expressions I don't notice any urrrghhh reaction to me.

I usually just make sporadic eye contact - look, hold for a few seconds, look away - there’s no point in getting into staring contests. Sometimes for emphasis I’ll hold eye contact a bit longer, but I find it uncomfortable as well. I think most people do, and so it’s perfectly fine not to make eye contact in most cases. I do make eye contact with girls I find attractive. Can’t help it, I just like looking into their eyes.

Like a lot of things in life, a balance between the two is probably best. You're right - you don't want to avoid their eye contact completely, but you also don't want to stare them down. I think it's best to hold eye contact for a few seconds at a time - not too short to seem like you're not listening, but not too long to seem that you are staring into their soul

My view on this is that everyone goes through life doing the best that they can, given the background that circumstances and their parents gave them. Perhaps that psychiatrist was abused as a child, you don’t know. But I feel that people inherently do what they can to make a good life for themselves and their loved ones. So when we come across people who hurt us, it’s often that they are carrying out patterns that they have inherited from their parents, teachers and so on. The whole process of rectifying these things, of introducing greater compassion and removing old inherited harm, is something that psychologists have been working at for ages. The process of working through our own trauma is something that takes time. Finding ways to love ourselves, forgive ourselves for things we did which in hindsight were maybe not right, accept ourselves in the present moment and in the past, these things are all difficult but very worthwhile. It’s good to spend time and effort on introspection, on why things are the way they are, and finding some love for that boy with Tourette’s.

When I was arrested by the Counter Terrorism Police in 2010, I was sectioned. I made it clear I would have a proper pop at them and the NHS in court. One of the officers said he was keen to see me 'get the help and support' I needed. He, for his own part, probably meant it. I was sectioned, and left to the dirty twats in the NHS. I have tried long and hard to resolve this matter. But so far, I have only spoken to the Police and the NHS themselves about the matter. Sometimes nicely. Sometimes not so nicely. It was recently said: 'have you ever known the coppers not to respond to someone so distressed....' I made two 999 calls, and the Police threatened me saying: 'Don't call again. Or we'll come and see you'. Wow. Just fucking Wow. Talking to the Police and the NHS about this now is a fat, useless, waste of time. But there is such a thing as charitable and unbiased victim support. And there are such a thing as journalists and lawyers The Police and the NHS officials who have been involved in my case, need to know that no matter how much shit they throw in my direction, and no matter how black a picture their stitch-up ambush seeks to paint of me, that will reflect on them also. And much, much more than they have prepared for. They have had their chance, and now I am taking it forward, to an open court if necessary. And there's nothing they can do about it. I intend to hold the professionals as accountable as possible, and metaphorically rip their fucking heads off and their hearts out, and lay them to waste on their own turf I am going to make them known, and put an end to them.

The cowardly, dirty, corrupt, vermin police and NHS officials, who have shafted me, covered things up so as not to be accountable, ambushed me to make it harder for me to complain and have the confidence to seek effective redress, need to know fully: all their dirty, dirty work has been in vain, and they have FAILED I am going to knock them down. just to add, I have NEVER been so committed to anything, in my entire life. I am going to choke the life out of the corrupt Police and NHS twats in court, and knock them the fuck out anyway I can.

I suffered from terrible head shaking and blinking as a child when going through relentless physical and mental abuse off parents, family members and other kids my age, it got to the point i couldn't concentrate on anything because of it and the abuse i got off people got even worse because of it. I thought it was me with the problem and blamed myself for years. When i started reading psychology books in my late teens and into my 20s then i woke up to the problem not being me, it was all the bastards giving me shit all my life. I took control of my life and read up on all kinds of subjects then became confident to the pint of arrogance and i showed noting but contempt to all and anyone who tried to put me down. My ticks stopped and for the last 20 years i only ever get them if i am stressed. i find they stop when i try not to focus on them, forget you have ticks and they seem to go away, or at least thats what i have found over the years.

I have created such a scheme: our emotions have impact on our thoughts and our thoughts - on our actions. When changing emotional state we are changing our actions as result. Now I will try different methods to control my emotional state. Emotional state does not mean just sad or happy. It is a very complex phenomenon.

It doesn't look like it effects dopamine, but I only looked quickly, the TD thread was about antipsychotics which antagonise (restrict) dopamine. Escitalopram looks to be a SSRI which means it mainly works on serotonin (by increasing it). Wikipedia says "SSRI can rarely cause extrapyramidal side effects including akathisia through the indirect inhibition of dopamine" but whether TD is recorded I don't know. Stick to your guns, it's criminal how every time someone diagnosed with a mental health diagnosis has complex health issues due to the meds they describe they fob us off and put it down to mental health to cover their arses. To try and stick us back on the same substance which caused us such harm is sickening. I'm fighting that fight myself and know how it feels, but if we don't fight for ourselves and each other who will. I think the one thing we should all try and do is make it easier for those who face the same problems after us. For me it makes my experiences mean something if others can benefit. The main way I can think of is by reporting side effects of meds online and to the relevant bodies. In the UK that body is https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ and I encourage anyone with bad side effects to report them if they feel they have the strength to do it, because not enough Doctors are doing this which reinforces their head in the sand approach by making side effects look rarer and less significant in the stats. You can report side effects to rxisk.org too and print off a report to take to your Doctor if you like. If your Doctors wont listen advocate for yourself and insist on finding ones that will. If you're not up to doing that find an advocate and ask them to do it for you.

The information I read earlier stated that this condition could be sparked by any substance / drug which "disagreed" with a patient. It cited sertraline and one other SSRI which had provided evidence of patients being diagnosed with this condition on withdrawl. So SSRIs can affect you too perhaps. There is perhaps less evidence with these drugs being less "heavy duty" than the anti-psychotics and perhaps having been observed less...particularly the newere SSRIs - of which Escitalopram is one. I knew about the reporting system and did indeed report the drug using the yellow card system. I have tried for several years to be taken seriously over this, and have ended up in the psychiatrist's chair! He seems determined to trash my concerns. The cardiologists were far quicker to consider psychiatric drugs as the cause, although they felt that what I suffered could not be termed "withdrawl symptoms." I am questioning whether it is worth the fight. I am much better now and, in terms of my heart, nothing can be done. It is better perhaps to come to terms with it, limit further derrogatory psychiatric investigations and to deal with the resulting increase in anxiety as best I can with therapy. Seeking help from professionals who use pills is the last thing that I want....so why turn to drug prescribers for advice and help? That's my view, although the bitterness and anger still burns very deeply I must admit.

I had dyskinesia of my tongue and mouth just over a year ago, amd I still do to a much milder extent. It was caused by antipsychotic drugs...in particular the less sedating older ones, although years of AP's in general could not have helped. I thimk for people in there mid twenties (my age), obvious TD is still relatively umcommon. Only yesterday I was told I will still have to avoid non sedating and older antipsychotics. Whatever the theoretical debates on this about the risks of different antipsychotics, it seems the general consensus and reality (in my view amd experience) is that certain antipsychotics place us at higher risk than others, although that is not to say they are less safe overall. I don't think SSRI's would give you TD, as that's not the way they work. I heard that lithium can, in extremely rare circumstances, cause TD - although I don't know how true this is. About the relationship betweem TD and tourettes - it seems unlikely, as older dopamime blocking drugs (that very heavily target what they call the nigrostriatal pathway - drugs doing this are a cause of TD and movement problems) are sometimes used to TREAT tourettes!

If you told your pdoc that you are ok he wont change your meds. Try not to worry, easier said than done. Try using distraction techniques - if i find myself chasing a thought i tap myself and say STOP. this repeated over and over again has really helped me stop chasing the thought. It may sound a little daft but it has helped me so maybe worth a go? You seem concerned so did you want him to change your meds? Are you worried that you are feeling ok? Its ok to be feeling ok!! Keep talking, Hugs Fox.

I think it's normal for a pdoc to say that si please try and not focus on it

Have you ever had any help with these impulses? I think people desensitise normally to get the person to bring them under control. So its about doing a job and waiting, timing yourself to not act immediately on the impulse to check, but wait 2 minutes and live with the impulse for that length of time. Then wait 3 minutes and build it up. If you can't bear it, go backa step and start again from there.

I know that we create ruts in our brains and that drives our behaviour. The trick is to make new ruts in the brain which are healthier and that inturn weakens the old ones until they stop working altogether and don't cause us problems. I think a behaviour based therapy will help you a lot.

I certainly have this, lol. I stress about how the other person is going to take what I say, lol. I'm also OCD about editing what I say on forums in order to convey everything that I want to say and also not have it be offensive, lol.

Once you've checked it once, thoroughly checked it of course, and closed the lid, could u try putting a tick ob the box or a star sticker on the box which tells u it HAS been checked and is aok and thus needs.no more checking.

I’ve done a ton of research and reading on the subject, so I’m familiar with understanding the issue & treatment options, etc... the question is moreso about how to connect with her and talk to her about it when she is so sensitive and afraid that talking about it will make things worse.

Hello, i'm sorry to hear about your child. It's very tough question and situation you are all in. Perhaps this is something you can bring up with a mental health worker. Right now i can only say what i would try to do in such a situation and that is use evidence/science as you have been in researching this matter to help her ease into a discussion.

Your daughter is very blessed to have such supportive and loving parents as yourselves. It sounds like you are doing all you can by giving her the space she needs while providing distractions. Perhaps she is feeling ashamed for her thoughts and feelings? Unfortunately, our society has stigmatized illnesses like anxiety and depression, which makes it harder for people to talk about it. I think that talking with a psychiatrist is a great start. Sometimes, it is easier to talk with a stranger than someone we love because we do not want to let them down or disappoint them. How did that first appointment go? Was she receptive? You can’t force your daughter to talk, but what you are doing right now – being supportive and loving – is exactly what she needs. When she feels “safe”, she will come to you. I will keep your daughter and your family in my prayers and asks for God’s calming peace and healing hand. God bless.

Whether the thoughts are called OCD or not, they are just thoughts in the mind and you are not the mind. You are not your thoughts. They are not who you are.

You are not evil and those thoughts are not you.

Have a look into mindfulness meditation, it could be of help to you.

I feel ya.I used to really struggle with the same thing quite a bit,and I still do at times when my anxiety is high. I use distraction,anything to take my mind off of it.When that doesn't work(this may sound weird)I pull the top of my shirt over my nose and mouth.There's something about feeling my warm breath that takes the 'I can't breathe' anxiety away.Or sometimes just wrapping a scarf around my face works too.But since It mostly happens to me when I'm trying to sleep at night, putting the blankets over my head takes it away.

Sorry to hear that I have suffered with it now since my anxiety started it’s an horrible obsession, I don’t know what to do I’m not on meds but I know suffer with anxiety and depression, it’s the worst obsession to have but we are still here it’s our stupid minds

The best way to deal with your anxiety is to make sure to use deep breathing techniques. You can look them up on Google.

I also have an obsessive mind where thoughts get trapped. You say your thought is about a past event. There has got to be a way to let it go. You say that you will "always keep coming back and feeling unfinished with it" but that sounds like a decision you are making. You could decide the opposite and let it stay in the past. Not knowing the exact thought makes it hard to be helpful. But it is not logical that a thought will stay in your mind forever unless you are making it so. Anxiety can be tough, good luck!

t's clear that you are effectively chasing an impossible dream. You are looking for an ending in an infinite loop of thought. I know this sounds simple, but write it down and leave it. Somehow, you should find a way to realise that this repetitive thought process isn't helping you at all and is a drain of energy - after all, "Qui bono?" - who benefits?. No one!x I hope your anxiety improves.

Your anxiety is what's making you think about it. Try to meditate!

How long has she had it? Make sure she drinks plenty - just little sips if she can't keep fluids in for long, but give her things to drink. A fizzy drink that's been left out to go flat is good - as is a glass of water with a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of salt in it - it replaces the salts and electrolytes.

Get her to check the colour of her pee (sorry to be gross) if it's pale, she's drinking enough and isn't dehydrated. I'm sorry to hear babout your anxiety.

Your anxiety is what's making you think about it. Try to meditate!

Diarrhoea is not usually serious, when someone has cancer it can be serious then. Don't be anxious.

Hello, Jane! It sounds like the crux of your relationship problems do stem from your mental health—more precisely your anxiety. But there are ways to fix this. One thing you need to learn is to become independent in how you cope with an "episode" (as you put it). Instead of relying on your partner to reassure you all the time, it's good to develop the skills necessary to reassure yourself. I'm currently struggling with the shame issue. Since the bulk of your intrusive thoughts revolve around a paranoia you have no rational reason to believe are true, it's very likely you simply need to reality test with yourself or keep your mind off of these thoughts. For this, you will need two major things: structure and coping skills. It seems like communication has been stagnant in your relationship, and that's more than likely because your partner is struggling to help you and is becoming frustrated—or possibly feeling helpless. One good thing you can do is reduce the workload on your partner's shoulders. For obsessing thinking, the best thing to do is reduce the amount of time you have to think about these thoughts. In the heat of the moment, you need to be able to identify that these thoughts are irrational—they have no basis in fact whatsoever—and that you are stronger than these beliefs. You also need to identify that these are just thoughts, and that thoughts don't need to translate into behavior; you are stronger than them and you can overcome them. As long as you believe in the power of love, and you really do love your boyfriend, your willpower will be strong enough to overcome this. I would recommend bringing this up to your support systems (e.g doctors) if you haven't already, they will offer more immediate insight into the problem than I can. I would also recommend writing, drawing, exercise, meditation, and reading as potential coping skills to distract yourself with. Having phone apps is good, too, but sometimes you need something more hands on. Hope all goes well!

I want you to know, first of all, that you're not alone. And I'm so glad you're here on this forum! There is an odd amount of good and healing that can come from a common struggle among people, even just over the internet. I have struggled with something similar, even being married. I always imagine he doesn't really want to be married to me or he thinks I'm horrible or he wants to leave, etc. It's really hard. I, too, struggle with anxiety, so I know how difficult it can make things. It sounds like you have panic attacks about your relationship quite often. I'm really sorry. That's super hard on both of you. Since you are doing so many different things to try and help, maybe try something simple you can do on your own without help. Get a notebook and write down the thoughts you typically have about your boyfriend (I refer to these as lies). For example, "My boyfriend is cheating on me" or "My boyfriend doesn't love me" or whatever else you can think of me. Then next to it, write what you know to be true, even if in the midst of your episode you don't believe it. It's usually the opposite. For the first one, it would just be "My boyfriend is not cheating on me" and for the second it would be "My boyfriend loves me." Then after that, write down positives (truths) about yourself. "I am kind. I am smart. I am capable. I am unique. I am talented. I am beautiful. I am loved," etc. Read them out loud. It really starts to shift your thinking and can help when you start to go into an anxiety episode, your brain takes over and starts repeating the truths to you instead of the things that are not true about your situation. I hope this helps a little. Blessings to you, sweetheart.

I'm sorry to hear about your anixety. Try vipassana meditation.

I try to stand up really slowly and eat a high salt diet, I am not sure if the high salt does anything but I love salt so I use it as an excuse when people comment on it. Has your doc tested your blood pressure, I know you can get some meds for it but as mine was tested as normal and I don't really want to take more meds I didn't push it.

Have they done a sitting and standing blood pressure on you? That might help with your dizziness and anxiety.

physicians recommend drinking 2 litres (4 pints) of water a day. But you need the extra electrolytes (potassium, sodium, magnesium etc) too, or else your kidneys will just get rid of the excess water.

Hiya and Welcome to the forum. This is an awful feeling to have and I do feel for you. Have you explained this to your partner and asked them to help you? Can you isolate what happens just before the feeling emerges and examine what may trigger you? Usually there is a trigger however bizarre you might feel it is. I was taught to do chain analysis. That is to find the event and back track in detail to what came earlier until the source might be found. One example was when i went into a shop to buy some shoe racks. Suddenly I felt an overwhelming desire to cry and found the words "you must die" going through my head! I went outside and thought about what happened just before it and I found I had a flash of my husband's face. Then I heard his voice saying "don't waste your money like this". I realised that he was a carpenter and if still alive would have made some really good ones instead of buying them. I then felt the tide of grief hit me a little even though it was years ago that he died. All that over shoe racks! That is a simple example, there are usually more stages in the process. I hope that helps.

I am also on olanzapine 15mg. It is a sedative drug, and also makes me sleep a lot. I always used to look up the web at work, but yeah some places don't like it. In my last job you were allowed but some websites were banned. Meh. Well done for holding on to your job, they do appear to be understanding.

I don't know about happiness. When you are mentally ill your life choices diminish. Either you are on benefits, or you can get some sort of job but both are a battle. If I were you I would focus on your mental health for now. Try to reduce your stress, and make your life simple.

It's probably the best advice I've been given. I think panic itself is because it's brain taking on too many things at once. How to deal with this however is highly complex. Easier said than done to just 'chill', but I think trying to split things up is best choice to try. I use this method (occasionally works but takes work and the outcome can be minimal, but which is better than never I suppose!)

I used to be a senior sister in charge of 3 units and got into a state like you worrying constantly and blaming myself for everything. You get to the point where you can't even see your way out even though you know what you should do. I think if you continue like this then you may have a breakdown. I can only tell you to take a month off work and yes, the place will survive without you believe it or not. I know you probably won't believe me but its true. If you go on in this state you will be forced to take time off any way.  May I suggest you see your doctor to get signed off and take the first week just sleeping because I will bet that you aren't sleeping much. Lack of sleep is the number one thing which worsens everything. Maybe ask for a short course of Valium (they only give a weeks worth anyway), and get that panic under control. Once you feel more yourself then go for the therapy you keep putting off. It won't cure you instantly but you must know that its essential as you mention it in your post in a roundabout way. But you really should take the time off work before things blow up even further in my opinion.

I'm sorry that this is what you've been going through. Anxiety can be super tough to deal with, so I recommend that you reach out to as many people as possible and talk to your friends and family.

This sounds absolutely terrible. Thanks for sharing your experiences. I would find the best therapist in your town and share this with him/her. They might have some amazing insights that could help you.

It is good that you are able to speak about your issues, have you told anyone else this? Your wife for example or even a doctor? I can't really give advice on marriage since I am unmarried myself, so I feel that speaking to someone woth that experience may help you understand your own anxieties associated with it.

Don't try to not think about something which you not want to think about, but focus your attention on something completely different. Focus your attention on things which are pleasant for you, that you want to experience, not on such things which scares you.

I can understand being trapped by a wrong decision whose consequences will be around for years, ham stringing me from many opportunities and forcing me to live a particular way that restricting and oppressive. If this is you then first I'd say did you REALLY make the wrong decision. You got married for a reason, followed work to a new area for a reason. Maybe you've lost hold of all the +ve reasons behind your decision(s), and are thus feeling (darn it, can't scroll up on my phone) lost? trapped? Maybe get back hold of them will make ya feel a little less arrrrgggh.

I have GAD, and have the exact same. It might be a mix of social anxiety and fear of not feeling good when an event is happening. When meeting with friends or family, or any appointment at all, I would feel extra anxious the day (or sometimes even 2 days) before. But exposing yourself to these situations helped me. No matter how awful I felt, I would try go to these appointments. I would wait until the fear would subside, and then leave. I still feel anxious about certain events, but it not nearly as bad as before, where I would feel anxious when a good friend would come visit for a cup of tea.

Hi there,  I am new to this forum and your post is a breath of fresh air to me as I feel exactly the same. I am 23 and also have anxiety and emetophobia. If I have an event coming up (or even something as little as knowing I have to go to the doctors the next day) I feel intense anxiety the day before and can't sleep. It makes me feel so si** that I can't eat and then get into a vicious cycle of feeling si** and needing to eat but can't. I dread doing anything fun or going out even though I really want to go, just because I worry about how I am going to feel. I nearly didn't go on holiday last year because I felt so scared of feeling ill on the plane or in a foreign country but I only went because I would have felt terrible on my partner for letting him down. The only way I can force myself to sometimes do things is to think of how much I might be letting the other people down. But now I rarely make plans so that I don't have to cancel them.  Although I can't give an answer on how to deal with this as I still don't know, I hope my reply can give you some comfort that you aren't alone in feeling like this! Especially being around the same age. I see so many people doing things that I would love to be doing - and things that I have done in the past - but feel that it would be impossible now!  All the best!

I think the problem with anxiety is it convinces you that you dont want to be doing these things and that, and that you would rather be in bed, while that may be the case in some instances quite often its not. The one thing I have found that helps is to capture a moment when I am out, and really pleased I am out, and try and replay it and tell myself this is a likely out come of going out today. Or perhaps argue against the anxiety, I dont want to go out to dinner, tonight. - But I dont think thats true, I like mexican food, the place we are going to tonight does good Mexican food, I like the friends I am meeting, they are good interesting people, and seeing them might take my mind off the problems.

I don't know if this applies here but whenever I'm confronted with a big bad, immediately my mind jumps into panic overdrive as I'm flooded with too many thoughts and feelings of doom and failure. What I have learned to do is give myself 5mins. Just 5mins of not thinking about the problem, not thinking about it at all. After 5mins the ahhhhhhhhhhbnonononon phase has passed and I am better equipped to look at the problem and work out an acceptable solution.

Oops that should have been tackle not tickle, darn auto correct.

I find meditation and deep breathing can be so helpful when trying to cope with panic. Being able to clear your mind can feel very liberating, so I'd recommend it

You've got to do what's right for you. It's a shame he won't seek help though. I wish you all the best.

Panic attacks are really tough. It's difficult enough to deal with anyway but it must be super-difficult in your line of work. I know you already know this, but I am sure if your colleagues knew what you were going through they'd be supportive. It's definitely not a sign that you're in any way incapable. In my experience, when I get low blood sugar, it can mimic the symptoms of a panic attack. I get the shakes and really out of breath.
So make sure you try to keep on top of that. Carry a banana or a cereal bar with you in your handbag, so you know you've got something there. Water is really helpful for me too. It's not so easy to 'just go to sleep' if you're experiencing anxiety and you've got physical health issues, but if you are having a sleepless night, it's still beneficial to be resting your body by lying down. Also just want to say that if you did have a panic when your students are all there, I can guarantee that someone in that class will be struggling with anxiety too and in an odd way, would feel less alone if they knew that it's actually not an uncommon thing. I really hope your appointment with the GP goes well and they can offer you support - ideally with any underlying physical issues and with your panic attacks.

i can understand exactly how you feel, reading this was like going back to the time when I used to have panic attacks at work. I used to work as a cashier in a big company, I loved my job at first and would talk endlessly with customers, but out of the blue I was serving customers (with about 50 waiting to be served impatiently) I was e only cashier on and it started to put pressure on me, I had a panic attack and felt like running it was almost like I had brain fog and my mind raced and I couldn't think of anything else so I'd distract myself by typing on the computer I worked on. Sometimes I did walk off even with loads of customers waiting and I too made excuses most the time I said I really needed a week it was embarrassing but I couldn't tell tem it was anxiety or a panic attack as I was embarrassed I went to my gp and he told me to have time off work which I said no to I tried to ride it out but it got worse so I did take time off and I unfortunatly lost my job over it. Just because my boss needed someone else who could cover my shifts and I had a lot of time off, I would go to the gp if I was you and see what medication could help, don't ever be ashamed you've shown me just about anyone could get it and that I'm not alone in it! And your not either! Sleep deprivation probably does play a part in it too my panic attacks get worse when I haven't had much sleep after a week so probably best to work on that too.

I'm sorry to hear about your panic attacks. The best option is therapy or meditation!

I'm sorry to hear about your struggles. I have a few friends who have been in a similar position to you so I know how frightening and terrifying the outside world can be. I also know how horrible it is when you get medication thrown at you and the help just stops. I was fortunate enough to change GP, and the support I got after that has been/ and is still immense.Have you thought about on-line therapy? My GP first mentioned it to me when I was resistant to try face-to-face counselling, and it is a great alternative for those who have fear of leaving the house, going outside, dealing with human interaction etc. It might not be a long term solution, but it might be worth looking into for the short term if you are really feeling low. One of my friends used 'BetterHelp' and couldn't recommend them enough. There are plenty of alternatives too. If you'd like to chat further, don't hesitate.

Hang in there buddy... But i am afraid the best modern science has to offer is pills, shrinks and hospital stays.. Works for some people.. not so much for others.. All you can do is try to stay positive and keep taking the pills.. i know that's easy to say.. But that's as much as the shrinks can tell ya... That and keep taking the pills

I also think some Skype counseling would be helpful. It's not as good as in-person, but it's something, and I've gained some from going that route in the past. Was there a defining moment when you felt this way, or was it gradual? Can you link it with graduating? Could leaving the relative safety of University and stepping into the relative unknown of "real life" play a role? I hope that you can find some help, and that you can continue to use the forum as a way of talking about it, so you're less isolated.

Hey man.. You were in a bit of a tough spot but you fought your way through it.. Well done.. Maybe you should do that more and you'll get better at it.. Least it got you out the house for a couple of hours.. If you had said no you would have been stuck inside all afternoon.. Which wouldn't of helped you any.. Allot of people in here have problems going out and meeting people.. But hey.. You did it

I think you are doing well enough, hats off for trying so much! The thoughts will vanish at there own pace, you cant force them out.

Try to sleep more and rest. This phase of your life will pass!

First I would like to say that you are not pathetic. I used to say the same thing about myself, and sometimes I can still feel that way, but I can guarantee you that you're not. I am 23 years old also and have dealt with everything you have described above. It is very good that you decided to see a therapist. That helped me tremendously! I tried to do that first for a long time before medication because I was also too afraid to take it because I was afraid of the way it might make me feel, and I was convinced that I didn't need it.  I have a phobia of being sick as well. I also am afraid of passing out or getting sick in public. This is exactly the type of symptoms that our anxiety gives us though. I would be afraid of passing out in grocery stores and going out to public places was horrifying.  A few things to remember. These symptoms that you're having are ALL due to your anxiety, and you can control them with practice. I'm not sure if your therapist has recommended meditation or not yet, but this helps me so much. I use this app on my phone called Calm. It has been one of the most incredible resources for me and dealing with my anxiety and panic attacks. Over time you will be able to better control your symptoms. This is also where the medication comes in. I know you don't want to take it, but the medication will help take the edge off, and will make it easier to start to get back to normal. I can tell you from experience that you will feel a MILLION times better. I was so scared and my mind convinced myself that I was having weird symptoms or that I might throw up or something, but once again it was all in my head. All you have to do is stick with it, and in about 4-6 weeks you will notice a huge difference. You can do it! Let me know if you have any other doubts. I promise you it gets better.

I will agree with the reply above. You are not alone on this and believe me we all make the same unhelpful thoughts when we feel anxious. I have the same fears with you..throwing up and faint in public places. But when I am out and I those thoughts comes to mind and make me feel dreadful and scared, I usually say to myself something like "who cares?". Even if I faint or throw up in a public place, who cares? I can do nothing to prevent it so..let's faint or do something more embarrassing. I remember once I was out for coffee with a friend of mine, I started feeling anxious and like I will have a panic attack. When I started to feel weird, I said to myself that if I am about to have a panic attack, let's have it. And I couldn't believe it how those feelings went away. Try to drive away the scary thoughts and replace them with something like "Whatever" or "Who cares" or try to calm down yourself when you feel like dreadful like you would have done to a friend of yours. So, my advice regarding this is to try to calm down yourself. And btw I have the same symptoms with you when I am out. When I first started to have panic attacks and anxiety, I read a book which helped me a lot and make me realize that I wasn't alone on this. The book I strongly advice you to read is "At Last A Life" by Paul David. It is an amazing book, the guy knows what he is talking about and it will help you understand a little bit more about anxiety etc. I would also like to say that I used to be like you. Afraid to go everywhere. I couldn't leave the house and I also have lost many friends cause I didn't want them to know anything about my anxiety. I really regret that I did this and I would not advise you NOT to do the same. If your friends are good and close to you, explain to them what's happening and they will understand. And it will help you as well the talking. Now, I can go out without worrying about faint or throwing up so much. I don't feel the same amount of anxiety when I go out but I still feel some. I guess this will go away with time. So, as you can see there is light in the end of the tunnel. You just have to be strong, have patience and faith in you that you can make it. I wish you good luck and if you feel the need to talk don't hesitate to pm me

I am hoping this helps. I can relate to so much of what the original poster stated in the and I wanted to say there is hope even if it may seem like there is not a cure. I suffered from terrible anxiety over a number of years and was pretty much housebound unless others took me places or I had what I thought total control.  Over the years I would not want to go out. I wouldn't venture into busy towns or cities, would not get on a plane of generally do anything where I felt trapped on not in control For numerous years I did not work, did not really socialize and was in a permanent state of anxious limbo. My prospects seemed pretty bleak and I could not see or find any way out. Panic attacks became a daily occurrence but I felt much better at home and stayed in the comfort zone for many years I stayed in that place and things just seemed to become compounded due to this

Yes, it will pass agoraphobia too. It's very common if you have panic attacks after a while to develop agoraphobia cause you start eliminating places due to the fear. I used to be afraid to go out of the house but now I can go out with almost no problem. (Still sometimes get anxious). You just need to have patience and try to do more of the things you are scared of. For example, one day you can try to go little further when you take your dog out. It needs strength and faith to get over this. I wish you good luck and have faith in you

Hello MsSki, I am so pleased to hear that you are feeling some improvement. That's a great start and you are continuing to move forward. I'm sure your dog appreciates the longer walks as well.!! I hope you can explain to your doctor why you have not taken the full dose of Zoloft. I'm sure they will understand and possibly make some suggestions. Good luck with getting to your next appointment.You can do it. Think of the progress you have already made, Best wishes, pollypop x

I use to take bespar also when I feel really bad and to be honest with you I love the way it makes me feel: like my old self..When I take it I don't constantly thinking about anxiety and panic attacks etc. I believe medications are here to help us and there is no reason not to.. If a person is physical sick you will not tell him not to take the medication and try by himself.. like that, is anxiety/agoraphobia/panic attacks etc. It's just some chemical imbalance on our head and it's absolutely fine to take medication for this.

Don't worry. See the interview as a good practice and notch it up as experience. You would not have been called for the interview if they did not think you were suitable.Try to remain calm, and wish you good luck!

All the best. No I don't think I would like a group interview either.

I certainly couldn't feel to attend a group interview, given the choice. With my communication difficulites, I would if i could apply for work, which I can't, prefer a one to one interview situation, or maybe where t here are 2 people interviewing certainly not a whole crowd of interviewees, I don't think i couild cope with that also.

Relationships are built on a foundation of respect and emotional support. Without this, a relationship can fall apart. I think that communication is key here - he doesn't know how you feel, and you may not understand his perception of this. Talk to each other calmly, and work through your problems together, in a respectful manner that emotionally supports each otherx

I can totally relate to what you are going through. My partner wishes for the same, for me to be able to join his online friends in voice chat and game together. As much as I'd like to, it's hard because I'm so insecure of saying something silly or stuttering and it makes me feel so anxious. I too have social anxiety and rather than supporting me, he just gives me the hard truth. He tells me that I will never get rid of my anxiety if I don't face up to it, but it's not as easy as just facing up to it. I feel like he doesn't understand too. 

You're not alone, so many people suffer with this mental illness. People who don't have it will never understand us. How we feel incapable of striking up a conversation with someone, performing in group activities, speaking out loud and how we hate being the center of attention or being noticed by someone you know at work. It's hard to take that first step but we must because social anxiety will persist if we keep up the same cycle. The negative thinking etc. We've gotta take that first step as hard as it may be. 

Don't worry it'll get better. I hope your OCD imp;roves. Try to ignore your thoughts!

I'm sorry to hear about your OCD. Why don't you see a therapist?

OCD can be very tough, I've been through it myself. Try meditating and go see a psychoanlayst!

I am waiting to be officially diagnosed with pure o ocd. But my therapist reckons I 100% have it. The things yoivare experiencing are what i go through. I have extremely unpleasant intrusive thoughts a lot. I also have developed a fear for things that never bothered me before like giving blood , getting injections or the dentist ! I believe it is just the ocd and Overthinkinf the situation that is the problem. I'm not sure how to over come this so I'm not much help sorry. But just want you to know you are not alone xx

your trauma can become PTSD or OCD or any number of things. It can transform and change. I was having nightmares and tactile hallucinations from the trauma I went through. It took a few years to stop. But it did stop.  I am so sorry you are going through all this fear of blood and needles and things on the television. I couldn't watch any movies about mental hospitals or I'd get very upset. It sent me back to the original trauma mindset. Your brother should suffer so. Are you in touch with your anger ??

Just a thought : I've always been the type to turn the other cheek when people hurt me. Being spiritual meant that I couldn't get angry. Our yoga group even had the custom of marking down on a sheet of paper how many times a day we got angry. There were thoughts, words and deeds noted. This was done to diminish anger. And indeed, a lot of anger is unnecessary. But years later I found that my anger was my power. I didn't have to end up anxious and sick if I owned my own anger about a legitimate offense against me. In this case, anger is a legitimate feeling. We aren't healthy when repressing a feeling. After the anger about the offense, I still had to understand the person and forgive the person. I still question the whole turn the other cheek business. To skip the real feelings and go straight to the rationalization of karma doesn't seem genuine.  Women and spiritual people are told not to ever be angry. When we go to therapy, they teach you to feel ALL your feelings. It doesn't mean you hang out in anger all the time or use anger as a weapon against other people. But I know I've been made to feel very sick and against my own self because feeling anger is "bad". My own sister verbally attacks me with anger about once a year. I always rushed to be spiritual and understanding of her. Not this year. This year I felt my anger at being verbally abused and decided NO MORE. I don't wish bad things to happen to her. I just am not going to stupidly engage with her and seek to find connection with her. I don't have to be mentally ill because I'm afraid of my own anger/power.  What I'm really reacting to in this post is the notion that spiritual people can't get angry. I suspect this may be rubbish.

Hi nickybow86. As I just told another forum member, I relate to these intrusive thoughts and I have OCD, so it might be. Anyway, if it makes you feel better, I've never lost control even if the thought was extremely terrifying and felt so real. I wish you the best.

I have a lot of the same thoughts and it is very distressing. OCD, most likely.

Sounds like OCD to me. WHy don't you get it diagnosed? Try searching online for a therapist.

Hi taurus12. I'm no psychiatrist, and even if I were, this is not enough info here to determine what do you have, but I don't think you are becoming a psychopath. I have OCD and I can relate to the intrusive thoughts you have. Sometimes I've thought of hitting my girlfriend in the face and I've been afraid that I might do it, but I wasn't mad, I'm not violent and I love her to death. Or thinking about dropping my nephew when I was holding him. Or feeling the urge to crash my car intentionally.

Oh my god this is me !! I just posted something similar. I get the same thoughts. Always have had them but they have gotten worse since I got sever depression. I have an app with a phycologist tomorrow so il keep you updated .

Sorry to hear what you're going through - it sounds like you are really scared. First of all, a psychopath would never question if they were a psychopath, so I don't think you are one. I'm not a clinical psychiatrist so I can't diagnose you as such, but it would appear that you may show some signs of OCD. I would recommend seeing a GP about this to get some professional helpx

Your not an psychopath, welcome to the forum. You probably have an obsessive personality. It would be best to see a dr to get help.  I hope this resolves for you.

I'm sorry you've had little help from Drs, or helplines. Would writing a journal help? To find out what your triggers are?

Try meditating. That is the best shot you have!

From what you've said here, you found two lumps in your throat, feared you may have cancer, found that having cancer would cause you anxiety, which would be so intense that you would end your own life. Making the jump between finding a lump in your throat and ending your life is irrational and doesn't make any sense. I think you need to reevaluate your thoughts - are these actually likely to happen, or are you focusing on a small chance that sometime may happen and amplifying that? You're capable of dealing with so much more than you realise - don't give up! We're all here to support you through thisx

You are thinking only of the worst case, what if you do better? What if your anxiety subsides and you get healthier? Really it's more likely that things will improve for you since you are here talking about your problems. Do healthy things, improve, don't give up.

I hope you feel better. Can you please reach out to your friends and family and tell them about what you're going through?

Have you had any therapy? Intrusive thoughts can often be confusing.

Intrusive thoughts are just that, nothing more. Use imagination to overcome them not will power. What I mean is try to divert to another subject when you get them, be imaginative in a positive way. I agree with Mayflower it might be an idea to look into some therapy to help with them if they persist. Usually its the brain playing tricks on us.

It's just an evolution. If you are getting used to the fact that you have intrusive thoughts and they are not as effective as they used to be then they may change in a way to make you anxious in some other way. Now you are worrying about whether the thoughts are how you really feel or something like that. It's still your brain doing the exact same thing, worrying.

Hi there Leslie, are you seeing a therapist for your OCD? X

if you see a therapist they have to know cognitive or behaviroual therapy and have knowledge about anxiety disorders. if you have severe problems, try medications.

maybe you shud try talking to your parents about these problems.

I have no idea about OCD as I am diagnosed bipolar, but I do relate to the distress it causes and wanted to just say that you are not alone on here. YOu know better than me what might work and what might not, so I won't come up with off the cuff remarks to you. I would say about the thoughts that getting random thoughts which disturb or confuse me are something I can relate to. But the trick is to reality check it. I tell myself that if its within normal parameters, do it (like taking off your jumper etc), and if I don't like it I can always reverse it, not drink the tea etc. I also ask myself if its something Joe Bloggs would do, and if the answer is yes, then I am more comfortable with it.

Typically you try going to a higher dosage gradually (also going off them slowly). If it doesnt work after 1-2 months, id say try another medication. If I remember, the recommendations are usually in this order: 2 SSRIs, 1 SNRI, 1 tricyclic, alternative or mixing medication before its treatment resistant. And obviously dont depend only on meds. try everything.

Be careful with relying on medications. I think you should try natural means before going to those.

No one understands do they? I hope you are ok

It sounds to me like you are obsessed with running and jumping, and your compulsion is to conform and stare quietly at the floor. During my experience with OCD, I have realized that I can be obsessed with absolutely anything. Might I suggest taking your mind elsewhere. your parents sound insensitive to your suffering. Have you told them you have OCD?

I actually have very much the same kind of urge. I've never heard of it anywhere else besides you or I. It affects my ability to do homework as I tend to run and jump around for a while and not do work. Then I stay up instead of doing it in the first place and that affects my sleep. I tend to not think enough to stop myself from doing it. Although lately I've been better at controlling it, I'd still like to know why this happens. With me, I start to imagine a situation in which I'm fighting or doing something awesome. Then it just takes over unless I stop myself or the scene I've created reaches its end. Does any of this sound familiar to you? I'd really like to know if this is something that happens or is just rare.

Ok , you stole a book when a youngster and have regretted it ever since. I would say that what you took did not put anyone out of business, it was a daft prank that you did not think through. You aren't the first to do something like that and definitely not the last, Had you been caught you would have not been sent to prison anyway.  The shop owner would have had someone give you a right talking to and maybe have you do a bit of community work or something as a punishment.

I think that your anxiety over this over such a long time has been penance enough for you. You have done your time in your head if that makes sense. And more besides... time to try and let go now and forgive yourself as the young person you were. If it helps, you could perhaps give something to charity.. it doesn't have to be money maybe something that you no longer use but someone might be grateful of? You are a decent person... you need to tell yourself this. 

Please don't beat yourself about it, You were young and I think many of us have made mistakes in our lives. I have to confess that I stole from a shop too when I was younger, I wouldn't dream of doing it today. You made a mistake and that is okay.

I'm known as a serial listmaker, and I'm proud of it! Lists help me with so much - groceries, to do lists, strategies, whatever it is, a list can be made. It's a great feeling when you manage to check off each item! I find it helps me to be really organised and punctual, and helps me to get on top of things. Basically, I love them to pieces.

They are very helpful! Highly recommend it will help with anxiety.

Checklists are great for anxiety reduction. Try using one.

Hi George. Please don't punish yourself for a minor slip up. You need to find out what's underneath your anxiety and anger. Then you won't need to take something for the anxiety and anger. If you were in AA or NA you'd have two white chips for succeeding at staying sober two weeks. I have had experience with the 12 Step programs and highly recommend them. Please stay on track. You can do this.

George, I’m so glad you’re doing better with the relapse. You know I was just at the gym and my trainer said, “Well, it’s better than nothing! Something is always better!” So keep the positive mindset!

I hope you feel better. Make sure that you take your time and improve your mind. Stay on focused on matters, more or less than that is not important.

OK, there is a lot going on here. I'm not surprised you are so upset. Intrusive thoughts are part of OCD, but of course everyone's intrusive thoughts will be different and could depend on the types of things we are anxious about.Your religious beliefs obviously influence how you see the world, and therefore the types of things you would feel anxious about. Hopefully the medication is helping you. I don't think you want to be a Satanist, and you can't be a Satanist (or in fact, hold any other belief) against your will. If you don't want to be a Satanist, then you won't be one. Having a belief is about making a conscious choice to subscribe to that belief, with the exception of people who are delusional. I think that the worst thing you can do is to expose yourself to Satanism, simply because you are making yourself more and more anxious about it. I certainly don't think that exposing yourself to Satanism will make you a Satanist, of course. Perhaps underlying all this is a crisis of faith of some sort. I am going to guess that you are a Christian as you haven't stated otherwise (I apologise if this is not the case). It's OK to have doubts or uncertainties or questions, it just shows that you are a thoughtful person. It sounds to me that your anxiety has built up and is now at unmanageable proportions. I think the most sensible thing to do is to seek professional help, as your anxiety is clearly having an impact on your life.

It doesn't mean its not OCD. I can't diagnose you because I'm not a doctor, if your last psychiatrist said OCD then it might be best to work on the basis that it is the correct diagnosis until or unless you get a second opinion. I don't have OCD, although I do have intrusive thoughts, but mine are very different to yours. Does your religion have a belief in Satan, or an idea that Satan could turn you from your faith? If so, then you have taken a belief that is normal for you and become very anxious about it, which is understandable in a way.

I think you need to look up pure O and you may get some relief, as for exposing yourself in the way you are - stop - you are making the problem worse, treating something yourself when you really have no idea what you should be doing is a very bad idea, exposing yourself like this is not how the treatments really work. It is great the meds have helped somewhat as it will help you interact with treatment, rather than treating yourself in this damaging and hapazard way why don't you look up where to get professional help form. Often therapy fro this type of problem can make a big difference in a fairly short time and they will teach you the skills. If you have a physical illness you go to the appropriate place to get advice and follow this you don't just treat yourself and this is what you need to be doing. If you do not you are just going to go round in circles.

Welcome to the forum, you could write down your OCD thoughts and then give them your therapist. It's best not to self-diagnose, are you able to visit your dr ? Do tell your dr about your thoughts as they are quite worrying. I hope you feel better very soon. Take care

I think you need to tell him about the OCD thoughts of harm in your next visit. OCD people will very rarely actually harm someone they imagine hurting. So you are unlikely to hurt anyone.

I think you shoudl try to write down your thoguths every time they happen. I'm sorry to hear about your OCD. 

Please get some professional help, visit your GP who can refer you for whatever is necessary. Take care

John you need to see the GP. Get some help

John, I get similar thoughts , and they are very disturbing. They are linked to OCD and there is an OCD website which I think is called OCD now, or something similar .If you root around your sure to find it and it explains these very symptoms you are describing. I dont act on these thoughts , but they cause me distress and it sounds like you are the same. I agree with the others though, you do need professional help with this as I have. Take care

Intrusive thoughts are so common for members here. The biggest thing with them is to NOT try to push them away, they just get stronger. I know that feels counter intuitive but it does help. Your brain is locked into a way of thinking and you have to break that lock. So, focus on tiny things - for me its perfume. I put some lovely perfume on, and smell it. Then when the thoughts get strong, I just say, "Yes, I can hear you, but now I'm smelling the perfume". You have to do it over and over again. Keep refocusing on what you are doing. Change your focus at times, as your brain gets used to the old one. But always acknowledge the thoughts, tell them you can hear them, that's OK, but you are busy elsewhere for now. As I said, worrying over them makes them stronger. Whether you are gay or not, and I suspect not, it doesn't matter. Don't try to analyse when you are in this state. You can do the analysis once you are more stable. I would suggest that you would benefit from some therapy and whilst CBT isn't useful for many things, it really can help with OCD.  There is a book which really helps and its deliberately written in large letters and VERY simply. "Emotional Hijacking" by Marlene Schneider Potter. She wrote it this way because she realised that people in an "emotion mind" can't concentrate easily. We have two main states, emotion mind and rational mind. The knack is to bring them together to make what is called Wise Mind. But it takes practise. Whatever you choose - eating a piece of chocolate very slowly, smelling perfume, doing polishing etc - do it with all your concentration and when thoughts pop in, and they will, just accept them, hug them, have a small half smile at them, and bring your focus back. I laugh at mine at times. Our brain has about 70,000 thoughts a day, so it will always have them pop in. Intrusive thoughts always tend to trip us up with frightening thoughts. Treat these like naughty children who won't stop screaming "I want this, I want that". Hope this might help honey. Don't make life changing decisions whilst like this though - I would advise.

At risk of going on too much - I have a friend who is a psychologist and he says, "Bore the thoughts to death", so he got me to write them down, Over and Over again on pieces of paper. I did it, got so bored and my arm hurt. But it worked slowly.

Ah...I used to have this. Horrible, isn't it? I started to avoid pictures of women etc. because I was scared I would get turned on and it would mean changing my lifestyle to start dating women rather than men, which I didn't really want to do because women didn't appeal to me sexually either. But I also thought I was just in denial and that I might suddenly realise I was gay and everything would change. It's awful, but it's anxiety, and you're right it's difficult to deal with intrusive thoughts that won't leave you alone. The only thing I can suggest is trying mindfulness - just because it's helped me with thoughts. This advocates not fighting thoughts (this makes them stronger) and instead observing them but recognising that thoughts are just thoughts and not reality.

Hopefully some members will come across your thread and offer some advice. I dont have OCD so i cant understand how it affects your life.

Hi Forever Bubblegum. You of course realize how absurd it is to fear something bad will happen to people you love if you don't do XYZ in a certain way and as long as you cater to it, this will continue unchanged. I suggest you challenge it in small increments. Disobey in small ways. I was obsessed with using the telephone constantly trying to find someone outside of myself who would fix me. I was on the phone ALOT. The doctor gave me anafranil but it didn't help at all. I had to put up little signs on the phone desks telling me DO NOT CALL !!! I had to stop myself. It was very hard.  That's just one of the main things I was doing. If you want to go into more detail about your behaviors, I am available.

There has to be some agency you could connect with and qualify for help. Call them to get help with your OCD.

Welcome to the forum, I'm sorry your having these obsessive thoughts. Sorry for your loss. Have you tried any therapy or medications? I've had constant memories play on my mind, I understand what your going through. Take care

I'm really sorry to hear about your OCD. Please try talking to a therpaist.

OCD can be really tough. I recommend that you start meditating every single day and try out a course called Vipassana.

Well, in spite of your spelling, I'm glad you posted.

I used to get into fights with my dad. Sometimes things got physical. I get angry a lot and inside I'm thinking, "I want to fight him so bad." But now I just avoid him to keep things quiet. I'm sorry about your father's abusing you. It's tough dealing with an abuser. Do you have a therapist to talk to? Or any medication for the voices? I'm not sure about everything you're going through, but when things get really tough it's okay to reach out for help. When I have suicide on my mind, it helps when I distract myself with something positive. It also helps to talk to someone. There are many nice people on this forum. If you ever feel ready to open up about stuff, we're all here to listen and offer advice.

I'm really sorry to hear about the way you feel. if you are hearing voices in your head, you should try to ignore your thoughts.

Intrusive thoughts are awful arent they? I get them randomly but i guess we have to rationalise are thoughts... and once you figured the thought is not true i guess the next step is remembering thoughts are just thoughts, they only become a risk if we or others act on thee intrusive thoughts. I find that even after rationalisation knowing deep down it cant have happened it still feels like a memory.. the film you watched probably triggered you off like you said. I have bpd and suffer with them makes life challenging but think how could that of happened. Thats my input anyways

hello Jay ,welcome to the forum lots of love from lucretia

Great to read that you've had success with overcoming your intrusive thoughts. One of my intrusive thoughts was related to being afraid to hold my nephew and niece (the same age as your children) due to thoughts that I may harm them.  I think the breakthrough for me was from a book I read (Overcoming OCD) that said everyone experiences intrusive thoughts. The problem is that a person with OCD is more likely to feel distressed by their intrusive thoughts. And trying to attack the thought or get rid of it from the mind has the opposite effect - it makes the thought more powerful. But with this comes another truth - that people with OCD are the least likely of people to act on their intrusive thoughts because they find them so distressing and abhorrent. Once we realize this and set about disproving our intrusive thoughts (in my case, holding my nephew and niece), they become far less distressing to the point that once the intrusive thought pops into our mind, it no longer causes any distress. That's the ideal scenario, anyway. In relation to what your psychologist has advised, I agree with the advice about spending more time with your children. But I'm not sure about trying to 'replace' the intrusive thought with another thought. In my experience trying to think of something else usually backfires.

You could always keep a pack of baby wipes, or hand wipes in your room for a pre hand wash clean up

I think sometimes wet wipes (especially baby wipes) can make hands feel slimy again because of whatever the lotion stuff is on them, but I would think if you've tissued and wet wiped, they would be pretty clean. I think your door handle would be safe

I'm a girl, but I'm married, so have been in the same situation many times during our sex life, if that's not too much info, lol

Youre not alone. Good luck with your OCD.

You are never alone on these forums. Feel better. OCD can be tough but you will make it.

I have never seriously been affected by OCD although I have been told that it does existWithin my mental health illnesses.Like you, I just want to stop being sick and tired of being sick and tired. My main MH issue is clinical depression. Unlike crying, am either emotionless or they are all kept inside. I worked out that have not cried in 7 years This is quite frightening. I have also become agoraphobic and also can't let people into my home. I don't know any of my life can improve, And wonder if things wil get better or worse. But I truly understand what "sick and tired of being sick and tired" is Hope things will improve for you.

Hi Leslie, I'm really sorry your going through this, what treatments have you tried? I do hope you'll get better. OCD can be so hard. I hope it helped posting on the forum.  Take care.

hang in there with the meds; you've got to give them time to work and it can take a couple of months for them to build up fully. then see how you feel. If no better, go back and tell your doc. I hope you feel better soon.

Don't let your thoughts control you.
