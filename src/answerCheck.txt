I wish I could go back in time and protect myself from the pain, trauma, and abuse I ended up experiencing from my ex-gf as well as my ex-best friend. Even though I try to remind myself that it isn't shameful to be caring and empathetic, I nonetheless feel so much regret, shame, and disappointment, and I am haunted every day by PTSD from betrayal, assault, and heartbreak. Although I feel some measure of pride and relief that I am the type of person to take ownership of my mistakes and learn from them, I am disgusted and terrified for the people they interact with, because they definitely aren't. Personally, I'm exhausted by other people's bullshit. I disapprove of doubting people by default, but definitely, if someone is actually showing conflicting signals, even if it's subtle, please listen to your instincts and drop/drift away from the person ASAP to save yourself some heartache. Like yes, no one is wholly good or bad, but there's a distinct line beteeen character quirks / weaknesses and flaws that tend to result in abusive, toxic, and/or invalidating behavior. I'm still trying to be cognizant of this myself so that I'm not too forgiving in the future. P.S. I'm going to give one identifying demographic - I'm female. Just to bring attention to the queer community and so that people don't automatically assume I'm male because I mention an ex-gf. But yeah. Abuse and sexual harassment / assault happen between two women as well (and naturally, between other genders too).

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

Hello does anyone here suffer from depersonalization/ derealisation? Basically it is the feeling of disconnect from yourself and other and reality. Like watching a movie of yourself. People usually have similar feelings when high or drunk. From what I hear people usually get it from lack of social interaction/ being alone. I just got this a few weeks ago and it is the scariest thing ever. I look into the mirror and my family members and don't recognize them. It has made my stress levels and anxiety to skyrocket past what they already are and made it hard to eat and i am losing a lot of weight. Ive never though of myself as antisocial but I stopped socializing to many people so I could just focus on my schoolwork about a year ago. I got better grades and was eating better but now this happened and im scared to death. When I talk to people it gets slightly better but I dont know anyone well enough to have long conversations with over many days.(basically a friend). Would anyone out there who has or does not have this be willing to talk to me/ get lunch for a while or let me join there friend group to help me break out of this?(basically do friend things and talk and stuff) Im not one to write stuff like this but I am very scared and alone right now and I have no one else to turn to. Hopefully some bruins out there can help out a fellow bruin. And only comment if you want to actually help me because I really need help.

...The good news: it's even simpler than that. Obviously it'll vary based on the circumstances some, but basically you just have to fill out the readmission application, talk to an adviser, and make a contract about how many classes you can take and when and what grades you need to achieve, etc. ... And then you enroll in your classes like usual (usually through UNEX in what's called concurrent enrollment) and move on. **Disclaimer: I am not an academic adviser... I just have far, far too much personal experience with this. XD**

I love UCLA, I really do, But sometimes I feel like the heavy workload and the stress of being a premed has sucked all my individuality out of me. It's like I have lost the core parts of my identity because I spend so much of my energy just trying to stay afloat. I guess that's why I love North Campus majors so much. They have the passion and charisma that I and so many others around me have lost.
[S]
Whenever I feel sad or super overwhelmed with life, I go to my professor's office hours and somehow he always makes me feel better. This is why I feel like North Campus professors are better than South Campus ones, because they care about both students' learning and wellbeing. Friends are a great support system too, but sometimes if my friend is having a rough week too, I dont want to unburden myself on her. Therefore, I'm so glad to have found a support system in my professors at UCLA. They really make me want to learn and be a better person too.  #uclasecretsprofessors #uclasecretssupport

Why do you want good grades? Grades are just one of the indicators for how well you know the material of a class. It was designed to fit everybody, so in reality it fits no one. It is by far not the only indicator for how good you are in your field. It's up to you how much importance you want to prescribe to it. I was never a great studier or a fast learner, so I had a lower GPA than most of my friends. But for me, school wasn't about grades. School was an opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn, and a degree was just a stepping stone to future jobs. So I didn't stress so much about my grades, paid attention to the classes I liked, and focused the rest of my energy on personal projects. I never even put my GPA on my resume, my projects filled the gap, and I landed decent internships (tho some companies did ask for my GPA. I stopped caring about such closed-minded companies). Point is, there are so many other ways to get a job, like networking or doing research or getting recs. School isn't all about grades, it means whatever you want it to mean. So figure out what you want to get out of it, focus on what you're good at, and don't waste your four years trying to meet other people's standards.

To those who have hit rock bottom or feel like they're losing their minds or are bearing the weight of each day on their shoulders or are bearing the weight of loneliness in their heavy hearts, others feel it too. You are not alone. Scream until you're listened to. Scream until your pain is heard. It's easier to feel your bones shake and to break down in the office of a psychiatrist than it is to wear the same disguise of everything is okay when nothing is right. And it's fine if other people find out that you aren't okay because one day you will be. Maybe not now. Maybe not tomorrow. But one day you will be. That's how getting better works. It's a process. Go talk to your doctor or your insurance company or walk into urgent care and say you need help. Do what you need to do to get better and that ALWAYS involves getting help from others.

I wonder everyday if I am worth living. I knew I was a piece of shit. I have shitty personality, I am not smart, I am not good looking, and I am not a great person at all. Coming to college, I knew making friends would be hard and I knew especially someone with my shitty personality, I knew I wasnt going to make friends. It hurts though. I don't want to kill myself because I want to believe life will get better. I feel lonely, lost, betrayed, and unmotivated. I feel angry at myself because I cant grow faster enough to be a better individual.I also drown my thoughts by getting busy but that makes me fell worse. I also don't want to share this to my parents because they will worry and I don't want to share to my friends because my mental health problem seems so small. Does anyone know what to do?

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

It is a shame your self worth is so low. But, it doesnt have to be. Your life and your attitude towards it is self determined. If you have a shitty personality, change it to a pleasant one. Personality is a choice not something that you inherited. A true friend requires work. So, work on it. Talk about them only. Ask them questions. Soon enough, they will take a real interest in you. Dont think suicide ever. You can do this because it isn’t that hard. It is simply a choice to be made. Good luck.

To my fellow bruins suffering with depression and mental illnesses. Things will get better Let me tell you this is the biggest lie in the history of lies. People tell me this all the time--when I'm having suicidal thoughts, after a suicide attempt, and even when I'm strapped to a hospital bed. They've told me this after they learned how I was destroyed as a child by other people. They are wrong. Things are the same. What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to just forget about it. (what an ignorant idiot they are)) But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

I totally feel undocumented immigrants because I was badly treated once with the consideration that myself is undocumented. My fucking ------ roommate who mentioned something about deportation to me. She is a crazy bitch and mentioned about deportation. I left the place with penalty because I did not want to live there with the devil. Even though I receive financial aid, it does not mean that I am an undocumented. Also, even if I was DACA, my immigration status shouldn't be blackmailed.
[S]
I know it seems tough now --- but it will get better pretty quickly. Just keep your eyes open as you walk through the campus and I'm sure you'll see a number of women who will take your mind off of your last girlfriend. And, be grateful for the fact she broke up earlier rather than later because the longer it goes on, the more difficult it is to get out.

I feel you, as an immigrant I can say that many of us are treated like second class citizens. I'm one of the DACA dreamers and I had to deal with similar occurrences. It is revolting and she is the devil!

I was dismissed from UCLA recently, and I feel like a part of me has died inside. I still pretend like everything is ok and when friends and family ask me about class I make up all of these elaborate lies. But the truth is I have nowhere to go. I fucked up to the point of no return. And I don't blame anyone or anything but myself. I brought this on myself. I just want everyone reading this to know that if you or someone you know is going through shit and its affecting your grades seek help NOW. Don't sit and ignore it like I did. Pls keep fighting. I promise to also seek help and fight as well. I wish us the best of luck. Love you <3

I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

Im a flaming feminist and Im here for you. This system hurts men and doesn't allow them much emotional release. A feminist who wants to see a better world realizes the pain of everyone. I'm sorry if others have made you feel discounted. There are so many opinions out there these days it's hard for good ones to be heard. I hope others don't discourage you from telling your story. I wish you peace

I am suicidal since I got major depression and anhedonia from LSD/MDMA combo 2 months back. Ive been going to therapy and its useless. They do mindfulness acceptance exercises but its all pointless. The fact is--and I told my therapist this--that unless this resolves in another month or two im out of here and will just kill myself. I dont give any fucks about mindful this or mindful that or CBT this or CBT that. One fact is I will NOT and I REFUSE to deal with a mental health condition i did not have before. If I cannot live my life the way I did before the mental condition, then i will not live my life. I will say bye to all my friends and family and it will be a sad tragedy but tbh there is no point in living with this condition anyways. And Meds dont work either. I had a pretty bright future as an engineering major but no more. I will not be tolerating this much longer especially given that therapy isnt curing me. Therapy is actually making me more suicidal by giving me dumb mindfulness exercises. The fact is therapy does not cure this and if I do not get cured then i see no point in living. I had 0% anhedonia before and for me even a drop of anhedonia is too much anhedonia. Mathematically, that is infinitely more than before and thus unacceptable and I will just kill myself. Anyways--I still have some hope. Has anybody done any rapid antidepressant therapy to get rid of all the symptoms such as ECT (electroconvulsion therapy)? Im scared of memory loss but hey its better than suicide right? #uclasecretsmentalhealth
[S]
If the therapy isn't working, then start running around the campus. Run to Wilshire, and then back up Veteran if you have to. Make strategic Spotify playlists to lift your mood while you run. It's good to run in the morning, and gaze at the horizon. Anhedonia is just apathy and insatiability, it's common to feel this way. You can tap into your subtle body and stimulate that which you're repressing. The brain is malleable, and nerves can heal themselves. Steve Jobs did acid to btw.
[S]
I’m so sorry this happened to you Please report this though. This guy could be harassing other women as well. Also remember the resources at school that provide therapy and such.
[S]
Do you do anything at all to manage your depression other than hoping group therapy, therapy, and meds will do something for you? If you're too tired to do anything else and you're feeling suicidal, it's time to check yourself into a hospital. I recommend Ronald Reagan if you have the UCLA insurance. Their service is great and the staff is lovely. You deserve to be alive. You deserve to see a smile one day in your reflection and feel it mirrors the joy you will one day have again.

Does anyone else ever feel like you have a bunch of acquaintances, but nobody really wants to spend much time with you aside from a hello, maybe even a quick hug? Close relationships have always been hard to come by for me.I think I'm a decent person--that I'm generally kind, compassionate, and sensitive to the needs and emotions of others. Sometimes I even feel like I am a bit of an old soul in a sense because I am mature beyond my years in some ways even though I still have a slightly dirty sense of humor. Not to mention romantic relationships. I have never had a boyfriend and I am a couple of years older than most college seniors.I'm not extraordinarily gorgeous but I also think I am not terribly bad looking. Sometimes I feel like people don't like me, and I tell myself that it's just all in my head or I just haven't given them a chance to like me because I keep to myself too much. But other times I think it's true, that people really don't see much value in being my friend/don't like me. I think it's normal for everyone to have people that don't like them. But when does it reach the point at which so many people don't like you that there must be something wrong with you? That people never respond to your texts or emails--because they don't like you or because they're busy? Surely if you were somewhat important to them they would answer at some point. I guess what I'm trying to say is: How many people that don't like you does it take to prove that you're just not likable? Like maybe if it's a small group--maybe 5 people- that doesn't like you, then surely it's on them for not liking you--there's nothing wrong with you/your personality/your characteristics. But if a huge number of people dislike you, then doesn't that say something about you, not them? I know getting people to like you should never be the goal in life, but if none of your peers like you, if you have no friends--what to do? I often feel that I can go the whole day at school without speaking to anyone except maybe a few words. Maybe that's why I talk so much at home...  #uclasecretsfriends

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it.

I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

Some people are hella immature. My advice is to just leave it. You can dive deep into the rabbit hole of psychology and never understand some things, it's not worth it. My guess is that she realized you're starting to like her, but she doesn't like you, and doesn't want to confront the awkwardness of talking to you about it. Or something like that. Another possibility is she met another guy and he doesn't like her hanging around you all the time. Or she wants to focus on schoolwork and finds hanging out with you distracting. Honestly, there's a million such variations but they all mean the same thing: Don't get attached to people until you know them for sure.

I am an Econ major and I hate it. My parents pretty much forced me into this major. Whenever I tell them I want to change my major, they always threaten they will stop paying tuition for me. For some reason, they think Econ is about trading stocks and analyzing its graphs. In reality, it is very theoretical and Math intensive. All the models are based on unrealistic assumptions. I hope I don't fall apart before I graduate.  #uclasecretsannoying

It is very brave of you to share the bad things happened to you and expressed your emotion entirely. Childhood does have a big influence on your mental health. You are not alone, many people have gone through Cal with depression, like me as a psych major. i was lucky to have friends who know about depression or went through similar problems together. not everyone could understand symptoms of depression and say things to make u feel better, but they do want to help you (except your Dad who might make it worse) try to talk to anyone from psych major, im sure they are, or even i am, happy to talk with you. Make good use of Tang Center, and campus counselling services like Student to Student Peer Counselling, they are on phone or in person. :) Go little Cal Bear, you will be great!

AAMC provides financial aid thru their Finacial Assistance Program that gives you reduced price in MCAT fees and free year subscription for MSAR (provides full admission stats for med schools). For your grade, look into post bacc/SMP/master programs!! Each program have their pros and cons, but you pretty much need to prove that you can handle a full academic load AND do well. I'm recent physiology major grad who graduated and currently enrolled at CSULA's academic enhancer post bacc. I'm doing really well and will most likely raise my gpa by 0.2!!! It's ok to take time and get it right, even if you already graduated. Good luck to you and anyone else

Give yourself permission to take a break! You are a lovely individual and your major (and uni as a whole, really) wants you to feel your major is your only source of worth. Please continue to do the good and wonderful work that you do. But schedule (please for the love of everything, schedule it so you can look forward to it!) five hours a week to watch that new show with friends, do that dance workshop, joke with the wine club, and reclaim your personality.

I am a former bruin, Asian female, who is currently going to law school in a southern state. I really miss how inclusive UCLA was. Here, I often face subtle discrimination which just feels normal now. Two times in the beginning of this semester when I spoke in one of my small class, the professor very subtly ignored me and moved on. She acted as if she was responding to me but she actually talked about something completely different that I was very confused. Second time when it happened, she later addressed what I said during the class without addressing me, and criticized what I said (in a way saying such thing) and it was very apparent to other people that she was criticizing my action. Also, even though she encourages students who normally don't volunteer in the class to speak more, she ignores when I raise my hand and calls everyone else who usually dominates the class. That happened twice and I stopped bothering to raise my hand. Recently, I submitted a research summary about a topic that I am interested in for my final research paper, and she sent me an email saying I sound so knowledgeable and she is wondering if I already know a lot about the topic. It is very frustrating how my good faith effort in researching and putting time in choosing the topic is just going to be interpreted that way by the professor who is going to grade my work. I replied with the sources I used and told her that I do not actually know a lot but did not hear any response yet. It is frustrating because every other students think she is a very nice person and would not think that she is doing this. She was also very nice to me when I was in her office hour that I cannot tell if she does this intentionally/consciously. Last year, my Asian friend who was in her class experienced the same situation and reported her to three different officials at school but no one was willing to take an action. The student affairs dean told my friend that it will only put her at disadvantage and do nothing to the professor if she were to seek further action. I will probably go to the professor's office hour tomorrow to address her email and my research paper in general. Any suggestion on how I should talk during the office hour?  #uclasecretsquestion
[S]
Act as if you suspect nothing. You don't have any 'ammunition' to use to do anything other than trying your best to get through the class and into another professor's class who will likely also do the same. Life is the way it is and it is difficult to change individually. Most individuals in a postion to do something are unwilling to go out on a limb so they perpetuate the discrimination. Take a deep breath and plug on. You'll be ok.
[S]
Acquiring true friends takes a lot of work. Most people don't take the time to filter out those who really don't fit their life. So, I would recommend taking a close look at your acquaintences and figure out who you think would add value to your life. Then, carefully but frequently, invite them personally (not an email or text) to get together with you for a meal or a drink. Then, when you're together, focus exclusively on that person. Ask about their interests, their likes and dislikes etc. If they ask about you, answer simply without long explanations. They will react very positively to that experience and you'll be well on your way to creating a very special bond with them. If you see a guy to whom you are attracted, just be very nice to him and he'll soon get the idea that you're interested. Good luck!
[S]
Whenever I feel sad or super overwhelmed with life, I go to my professor's office hours and somehow he always makes me feel better. This is why I feel like North Campus professors are better than South Campus ones, because they care about both students' learning and wellbeing. Friends are a great support system too, but sometimes if my friend is having a rough week too, I dont want to unburden myself on her. Therefore, I'm so glad to have found a support system in my professors at UCLA. They really make me want to learn and be a better person too.  #uclasecretsprofessors #uclasecretssupport

So I got introduced to this girl while I was studying and she is just so adorable. The things she say and the dumb snaps I get from her make me want to just squeeze her. I would love to take her on a mini-golf date, and go get gelato afterwards :p  #uclasecretscrush

I would say that it is entirely normal to have 'crushes' it's just just important to be aware that we cannot truly have any more than that as someone looking from a distance. Love can only really come from physical interaction and really knowing a person. Sure, we could obsess over them, but that isn't real because we don't actually know the person; they could be vile in reality, and if we base how we feel about them from the projections they make on social media or in the news, then we only get a filtered version of them, one that is unlikely to reveal any of the bad points about them. So, this would probably fall under 'idealisation' in that you see an ideal person, partly because that is all you're allowed to see and partly because that has become what you want to see. I am guessing that you follow them on social media and the like, so a start would be to break the habit of checking in on them, replacing this behaviour with something else more beneficial. Remind yourself that you don't know that person and that it would be far healthier to focus on 'real world' women and working towards meeting and getting to know someone in that way

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

You have been in this position a long time and it will feel shocking to you to be assertive with her. She is being very selfish. Your school work is work enough. When she is verbally abusive to you, you are old enough now to stop pleasing her and tell her instead that you do not deserve to be treated that way. And walk out of the house after you tell her that you do not deserve to be treated that way. Do not do the chores if she verbally abuses you. If you treat me that way, I won't help you at all. You can stand up to her. You are not her little girl anymore. Doing this will feel foreign to you. But she is being very bossy and unkind to a perfect daughter. I tried to get my mother's understanding and approval for years before I realized I wasn't going to get it.

I have a friend who got dumped by a guy she liked over the summer and I'm really worried about her. She was getting over him at the beginning but she recently found out some gossip about him having a new girl now and that put her back at square zero. When you ask her about it she says that she is ok but she's really not. Something about her has changed and she's become obsessed about her weight. She's lost about 20 lbs and keeps talking about wanting to lose 20 more but she will be really thin then. She hasn't been eating much either and she used to love eating. I'm worried to the point where I've come close to messaging the guy and asking him to talk to her.

Hey Friend! You've lost a lot of weight since I last saw you and now I'm really worried. I think you need to get professional help ASAP. I not doing anything until seven, so can we walk in together? We can grab some dinner together afterwards too.

That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

One thing that I'm too afraid to tell anyone is that my older brother took advantage of me growing up so now I've got commitment issues and trust issues. It just has a taken a great toll on me.. and I'm talking to someone but I don't think it will last bc I broke up with the last guy I really loved bc of my depression and whatnot. Which makes me even sadder hahhaha.. I try to laugh it off..

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

I'm sorry this has happened to you write. It is really hard to recover when you've trusted and opened up to therapists only to be let down in the end. I am in a similar situation with my psychologist. Took me ages to trust him, opened up to him about stuff I've never talked about to anyone else, cried myself through very difficult therapy, only for him to throw it all back in my face. He knows I have trust issues especially when it comes to men, because of my past, and he proved me right. I really don't know how you can move on from this, I'm hoping to meet up with an advocate after I've finished treatment to try and find a way forward. Not the same when the trust has gone though is it? I hope you can sort something out xxxx

My roommate does not go out... at all. He does not talk either. Literally he stays in our room all day after class, even to-go his lunches from b cafe or somewhere and eat in here. Floormates don't know who he is either. Im kinda getting tired of him being antisocial.
[S]
I feel for this women but i have a few questions. Why didnt you stop him in when he ran his hand down your leg?how did he manipulate you to go to your room then have sex ? Then you continued to have sex with him ?? Its not like he forced her to do anything. There seems to be two individuals with issues and problems
[S]
I feel okay. Like John Nash, I accept that my hallucinations are not real. They are not real people. So I can let them disappear in the distance. Do you think you could be projecting your feeings about breaking up with the child's mom onto the boy ?? Transferring your feelings onto a 7 month old baby is truly bad for the child. This is your son and he looks up to you. He is the wellspring of love. Let that love infect your being.  Adjusting to the idea that you are a parent for life, that is a big adjustment. No wonder you can't eat or sleep, this was a surprise for you, not a planned event.

Confession time: I don't think I've ever had a real crush/romantic interest in anyone. Doesn't really help that it took me a long time to understand what makes a person attractive, and that a person can be attractIVE to me without me being attractED. BUT I think I may have found both in this one person, at least in the aesthetic attractiveness and being attracted to the personality. I THINK. But I'm not sure? And we aren't like super close, but we've recently become better friends, and I can see myself having more romantic inclinations eventually? They are a genuinely good person, and I don't think I am giving them a halo effect. I don't know, IS THIS WHAT HAVING A CRUSH IS LIKE???
[S]
Acquiring true friends takes a lot of work. Most people don't take the time to filter out those who really don't fit their life. So, I would recommend taking a close look at your acquaintences and figure out who you think would add value to your life. Then, carefully but frequently, invite them personally (not an email or text) to get together with you for a meal or a drink. Then, when you're together, focus exclusively on that person. Ask about their interests, their likes and dislikes etc. If they ask about you, answer simply without long explanations. They will react very positively to that experience and you'll be well on your way to creating a very special bond with them. If you see a guy to whom you are attracted, just be very nice to him and he'll soon get the idea that you're interested. Good luck!
[S]
I think that particular person might just be that way. Sometimes people get harassed a lot by others propositioning them for sex - it's a defense mechanism to then be mean as a default state. Please don't let this deter you from continuing to hit people up as a friend :)
[S]
You talk about yourself as a decent person with decent qualities, but likeable is not one of them. Would you find yourself likeable at all? Could you expect people to like you if you imagine scenarios of people not liking you, as you are in effect actively finding reasons to not like yourself? Are you being too hard on yourself by defining likeable as having the approval of people who will genuinely like me, text me, and email me whenever I message them? Is it more assumable to think that keeping to yourself too much is making it hard for people to find things in common with you?

I swearrr you guys need to stop partying on the open area at the apartment near Strathmore and Levering every damn Thursday with loud music on until 3-4 am! At least get an closed area....

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

If all the guys you talk to are like that, then you might be hanging out in an area with a high concentration of thirsty guys. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy thing, since you're not exactly going to meet people who study at home on Thursday nights.


[P]
It's funny how all the guys I talk to think that all we girls want is to have sex with them... like I just wanna talk to be friends with you. Not to be a one night stand. Not even that, but at least have more than 1 conversation with me before you ask if I'm DTF. Honestly. wtf.

This is like saying I had 0% runny nose before the cold and I will NOT accept a runny nose. Deal with the circumstances you have now. Not before.

the fact that the other person reached out to you is a good sign!! sometimes u just gotta remind them casually like Hey u wanna grab dinner this wk? etc. also perhaps theyre busy with midterms but little gestures like that i definitely appreciate :)

Kira O'Connor Not sure if it's you but you certainly fit the bill so maybe? also OP, I don't think it's weird. They're students just like you are :P But maybe be careful about asking out the RA if they're for your floor until next year, /just/ in case it goes south.

Why do I feel lonely even when I'm surrounded by people I love and who love me back? I'm not even sure what will satisfy me at this point. It's really rough being in an environment of constant affirmation while feeling like I'm missing out by not having a deeper connection to someone special. It's not that I'm ungrateful for everyone and everything that's good to me. I really don't think I am. I just don't know what exactly would help me feel better. All I know is that I don't have whatever that is yet.

AAMC provides financial aid thru their Finacial Assistance Program that gives you reduced price in MCAT fees and free year subscription for MSAR (provides full admission stats for med schools). For your grade, look into post bacc/SMP/master programs!! Each program have their pros and cons, but you pretty much need to prove that you can handle a full academic load AND do well. I'm recent physiology major grad who graduated and currently enrolled at CSULA's academic enhancer post bacc. I'm doing really well and will most likely raise my gpa by 0.2!!! It's ok to take time and get it right, even if you already graduated. Good luck to you and anyone else

During my freshman year I was incredibly lonely. I ate at the dining halls by myself, I didn't talk to anyone on my floor, and I never went out on the weekends or even on my birthday. I knew it was my fault for being so shy, but I always felt like I was doing college wrong because everyone else was going out and having so much fun. Things are better for me now, but I still remember what it was like to be that lonely, so whenever I recognize an acquaintance sitting by themselves in lecture, I try to sit with them, even if I have other friends in the class. Especially if they're transfer students, since I know that makes it so much harder. I know it's easy to feel lonely in a place like UCLA, but that's going to keep happening if we don't open ourselves to new people. If you have a clique or friend group, consider opening it up to a stranger that you like. Or if you want to get to know a classmate better, have you and your friends sit with them in lecture. You could be saving someone's life, or at the very least make someone's day. And even if they actually want to be alone and you're bothering them, they'll make it clear, and you can just brush it off and go back to the comfort of your friends. I'm a shy introvert and I hate talking to people, but I also hate the idea of someone feeling like they don't belong due to loneliness.
[S]
I felt that way too as a freshman (and even part of my sophomore year) but it gets better over time! People can only hang on to their high school friends for so long. It may feel lonely right now but keep trying and eventually you will find people who will want to spend time with you. You're not alone. :)
[S]
hey, you do you if you're okay with being alone, but remember that not everyone can do that. it would be nice if I didn't get lonely, but I get lonely to the point of severe, impactful depression. that's not something I can just easily be okay with. so think before you say something like that so offhandedly

To all the freshmen/second years/ any-years thinking about how hard it is to make friends in college compared to high school: think about how you spent 8 hours a day at high school. Of course its easier to make friends with all the people stuck there w you for such a long time everyday!! My best advice is to join a club or team for something you really enjoy. I met some of my best friends when I joined a dance team!

This is unfortunately a very common problem nowadays. I've been there. I felt like my family could't recognize me after long periods of isolation in school. It is scary because it is new, and also alarming. Socialization is necessary for a healthy brain. Make sure to engage on friendships, listen and empathize with your friends.
[S]
Give yourself permission to take a break! You are a lovely individual and your major (and uni as a whole, really) wants you to feel your major is your only source of worth. Please continue to do the good and wonderful work that you do. But schedule (please for the love of everything, schedule it so you can look forward to it!) five hours a week to watch that new show with friends, do that dance workshop, joke with the wine club, and reclaim your personality.


[P]
Anyone else feel like they have a few friends but don't have anyone close? I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to like deep conversation wise Or even hangout on the weekend. Mainly Like 15min convos. Guess I have no real friends huh Just wanted to express myself anonymously since I can't really tell anyone how I feel. And no I don't think I'm depressed

While you have no reason to listen to this, you don't know me and you seem to be very set in your decision, please don't kill yourself. Depression and anhedonia are terrible, and living with them is horrible but please give it some more time. This is a brain injury, not unlike a concussion or a stroke and it takes time to heal. The brain is incredibly slow at healing itself. It often takes months and several different medications before you find the right one to mitigate the symptoms for you. Please, just don't give up so soon. While memory loss is better than suicide, the possibility of being able to feel happiness is even better than that. Just a little more time OP, for your friends, your family, but most importantly for yourself. You can get through this. Let the people around you support you and if you need more than that, we can change the first sentence I said and you can message me. I'm no one special, just willing to be a friend if you need another.


[P]
I had a huge crush on one very special girl for the entirety of my four years at UCLA. We were friends but I knew I didn't stand a chance so I did nothing. I wasn't able to fall for another person and I thought it was because she was still around or at least physically close enough in my life. Now that I graduated and moved to another place I realized I have truly lost the ability to love.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

My girlfriend recently broke up with me because she feels she needs more time to take care of herself and apparently I must have been doing something wrong because she went from telling me how I was the only guy who made her feel this way to leaving me. I am doing relatively ok now, but I feel hurt, I just wish people would say what they mean and when they make a commitment stick with it. I want her to do this if this is the best thing for her, but it seems like she should have known earlier. I am thinking this may not be a juicy enough secret to get posted, but this girl meant so much to me, the only girl I have wanted for all of 2017 and my heart breaks because I feel like we went from being great friends to her being upset at me when I did nothing. It is too bad that she will never know the full extent of what she meant to me, she saved my life several times. If she somehow ever sees this I want her to know I am not mad, just sad at how everything ended.
[S]
That is a terrible way to grow up! However, it is now your choice as to how you want it to affect your life. You can be a victim forever if you choose. Or, you can get it behind you if you choose. I think you should seek professional assistance and over time, put your past behind you and be the courageous, trusting woman you were meant to be. And, don’t be afraid to talk about your past and don’t be shamed by it. Take a deep breath and take the first step to getting past this.

Whenever I feel sad or super overwhelmed with life, I go to my professor's office hours and somehow he always makes me feel better. This is why I feel like North Campus professors are better than South Campus ones, because they care about both students' learning and wellbeing. Friends are a great support system too, but sometimes if my friend is having a rough week too, I dont want to unburden myself on her. Therefore, I'm so glad to have found a support system in my professors at UCLA. They really make me want to learn and be a better person too.  #uclasecretsprofessors #uclasecretssupport

So sorry to hear that life had been tough. Let me see if I have your story straight. You feel worthless because of your personality, ie a core part of you that you feel you cannot change. You think that people would not like or want to be friends with you. You probably stick to yourself and not actively try to make friends or you do and you fail. This makes you feel worthless again and continues the loop. Your feels, thoughts, and behavior is conspiring against you. This is a classic example a downward spiral. Please visit CAPS at your next convenience. Once you see your therapist, tell then that you are spiraling. They will help you. Your problem is not small. It is growing but it can be nipped in the bud. You sound motivated to change and really self aware, so I know you can do this!

I'm taking a class with a really young professor (he's 31) and I've developed the hugest crush on him. I'm 24 and I haven't even had a crush on anyone since I was like, 17. He's exactly the kind of guy I would have asked out if we'd met in a different setting. Now I'm wondering, once the quarter is over and the grades are posted, would it be appropriate for me to ask him out?? Or would he think I'm a complete idiot? I like him so much it's ridiculous...
[S]
Pretty sure OP is talking about the Anime class I'm in. I was so surprised when no one said anything. I guess the last 30 minutes of magical-schoolgirl-in-Feudal-China shojo were enough to crush everyone's spirit lmao.

Why in the world do you care what they do.....? So what? Maybe he has mental issues, maybe he's struggling and you don't even know and here you are judging them

Don't know if it's the American culture - it seems a very big deal when you talk to an opposite sex. This is the convo happened between me and a friend the other day. me: Hey what's you up to :) guy: You keep talking to me. I'm not into dating you though, sorry. I felt so attacked. I genuinely care about people it's not a matter of romantic or not romantic. When we were children, we can hit each other up, go to the park and not worry about things like this. Wish people could let loose & not make everything about dating.

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

I'm honestly surprised after what happened in Las Vegas and the extent of that horrific tragedy, nothing happened at all afterwards except lower morale. No changes to policies or laws, not even a well-known, national public discussion as for ways to prevent future mass murders. Gun control (stricter or more relaxed) shouldn't be the only issue of discussion here. Mental health is another. Psychology third. We should be understanding the thought processes behind these murderers and why they believe in killing. We should be looking for ways to dispel that wicked and demented belief at every opportunity. Take a look at today (November 5th) in Texas. 25+ more innocent lives gone. Millions more will have to go to their Sunday services or other places of worship with the unnecessary fear of being attacked. Security will be tightened, our freedoms possibly further restricted, and the process repeats itself again unfortunately. How much longer do we have to go through this before someone finally calls for a public debate in looking for legislative answers to mass murders?
[S]
It is very brave of you to share the bad things happened to you and expressed your emotion entirely. Childhood does have a big influence on your mental health. You are not alone, many people have gone through Cal with depression, like me as a psych major. i was lucky to have friends who know about depression or went through similar problems together. not everyone could understand symptoms of depression and say things to make u feel better, but they do want to help you (except your Dad who might make it worse) try to talk to anyone from psych major, im sure they are, or even i am, happy to talk with you. Make good use of Tang Center, and campus counselling services like Student to Student Peer Counselling, they are on phone or in person. :) Go little Cal Bear, you will be great!

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

I just really want to be friends with this person that's pretty reserved. They have a close group of friends partly bc they play a sport and so they're with each other 24/7. However, this person is the one who reached out and seemed to have wanted to be friends in the first place. Yet now they don't ever reach out or really communicate and I'm not sure if I'm being annoying by trying to talk to them. I really do want to be friends you seem like a cool person!!! I guess I'll be just around if you want to hang  #uclasecretsfriends

First of all if you decided to almost kill urself only after being rejected by a school, you gotta reevaluate your life. Happy for you but you got issues


[P]
Honestly since coming to college, I've really stopped feeling any emotions. Bottling up my emotions has been a way of coping with the stressors of life but it's reached a point where its not healthy. No one knows I'm hurting, no one knows I'm stressed and sometimes I don't even know if I'm hurting or stressed. There's not a lot of things that trigger an emotional response such as happiness or sadness. I almost got jumped and I didn't even feel a thing. My emotions are neutral but I have rbf so everyone thinks I'm mad or angry. They tell me to smile more but I can't smile if I don't really feel anything. I can still empathize with people but its difficult to express my own emotions or even know if I am feeling anything. This stoicism makes it hard to connect with people because I either come off as cold and unfeeling or an arrogant asshole. Thoughts? #uclasecretsemotions #uclasecretsstress

It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

I'm sorry this has happened to you write. It is really hard to recover when you've trusted and opened up to therapists only to be let down in the end. I am in a similar situation with my psychologist. Took me ages to trust him, opened up to him about stuff I've never talked about to anyone else, cried myself through very difficult therapy, only for him to throw it all back in my face. He knows I have trust issues especially when it comes to men, because of my past, and he proved me right. I really don't know how you can move on from this, I'm hoping to meet up with an advocate after I've finished treatment to try and find a way forward. Not the same when the trust has gone though is it? I hope you can sort something out xxxx

Random question, but I don't know where else to ask it - has anyone else noticed a trend of memes that are videos but could easily be images? As in they're just images with a very subtle special effect going on in the background? What are they trying to do, use up all our data? #uclasecretsmemes

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

I ate alone a ridiculous amount of times the past two years and it is great because you don't have to force conversation while simultaneously chewing food, you get some time alone to yourself at this insanely crowded school, and you can go at your own pace and leave whenever you want to and not have to deal with planning out when/where to meet with flaky college people. Ya'll need to learn how to be ok being alone, jesus.  #uclasecretsalone #uclasecretspreference

Honestly this is what I've been saying for ages. I love eating with friends when I can, but I have 0 issues eating alone.

Damn I could easily have been the one to write this. Same exact situation (down to the GPA), same drive. Best of luck to you, you're not alone.

Thank you for having the courage to speak up. It is not your fault. You are not alone. There are many resources on campus for when you feel ready to talk, and I'm here as well. Don't go through it alone. CARE: http://www.careprogram.ucla.edu/

'If you're no good in bed, there's nothing good about you. You're not smart, you're not good looking. Honestly, why am I still with you?' Do not pressure us into things if we do not want to. Especially if we said so before. I lost my virginity 5 years ago, and the stigma is that guys can't be raped. Well, trust me. I definitely didn't enjoy it, and it affects my relationships to this day. Coerced consent isn't consent, no means no, and consent is revocable. #MeToo #uclasecretsconsent #uclasecretsconfession

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same..

I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly..

I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was...

Why do you want good grades? Grades are just one of the indicators for how well you know the material of a class. It was designed to fit everybody, so in reality it fits no one. It is by far not the only indicator for how good you are in your field. It's up to you how much importance you want to prescribe to it. I was never a great studier or a fast learner, so I had a lower GPA than most of my friends. But for me, school wasn't about grades. School was an opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn, and a degree was just a stepping stone to future jobs. So I didn't stress so much about my grades, paid attention to the classes I liked, and focused the rest of my energy on personal projects. I never even put my GPA on my resume, my projects filled the gap, and I landed decent internships (tho some companies did ask for my GPA. I stopped caring about such closed-minded companies). Point is, there are so many other ways to get a job, like networking or doing research or getting recs. School isn't all about grades, it means whatever you want it to mean. So figure out what you want to get out of it, focus on what you're good at, and don't waste your four years trying to meet other people's standards.

My friend from high school just started school at UCLA this year. During first week, we were hanging out pretty much every day and I felt like we were getting really close. I even began to develop feelings for her. But she just suddenly stopped hanging out with me and I'm not sure why. Every time I asked her to go to dinner or just study together, she would turn me down. I've been feeling pretty depressed about it and it seems like she just doesn't think I'm fun to be around anymore. I talked to her about it on Facebook (I wanted to in person, but she always makes excuses to not meet up), but she just acts like nothing is wrong, when clearly something has changed. I don't know what I should do. I really care about her, but it doesn't seem like she has the same feelings toward me. #uclasecretsfriend #uclasecretschange
[S]
Some people are hella immature. My advice is to just leave it. You can dive deep into the rabbit hole of psychology and never understand some things, it's not worth it. My guess is that she realized you're starting to like her, but she doesn't like you, and doesn't want to confront the awkwardness of talking to you about it. Or something like that. Another possibility is she met another guy and he doesn't like her hanging around you all the time. Or she wants to focus on schoolwork and finds hanging out with you distracting. Honestly, there's a million such variations but they all mean the same thing: Don't get attached to people until you know them for sure.
[S]
If all the guys you talk to are like that, then you might be hanging out in an area with a high concentration of thirsty guys. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy thing, since you're not exactly going to meet people who study at home on Thursday nights.
[S]
The fact that she is no longer into hanging with you means that you might need sometime alway from each other to discover more about yourself/herself. Find new circles of friendships and other people who feel like they need to hang

someone very close to me died recently and anytime i hear words to do with death or dying or even when someone makes a joke about wanting to die im immediately triggered and can't get it out of my mind.. i feel like this is going to be on my mind all year and i really need help but I don't know where to start :( i am not ok  #uclasecretstrigger #uclasecretsdeath

It is very brave of you to share the bad things happened to you and expressed your emotion entirely. Childhood does have a big influence on your mental health. You are not alone, many people have gone through Cal with depression, like me as a psych major. i was lucky to have friends who know about depression or went through similar problems together. not everyone could understand symptoms of depression and say things to make u feel better, but they do want to help you (except your Dad who might make it worse) try to talk to anyone from psych major, im sure they are, or even i am, happy to talk with you. Make good use of Tang Center, and campus counselling services like Student to Student Peer Counselling, they are on phone or in person. :) Go little Cal Bear, you will be great!
[S]
I miss the deep conversations too. Message me and i would love to do something with you sometime :)

all these false priests and charlatan of eCONomists use their unrealistic assumptions like perfect rationality and self interested actors to maintain the dominance of the rootless capitalist rent seekers by spreading the twisted sick dogma of neoliberalism. there was this one time i read an article on behavioral economics so it's pretty clear to me the whole field is a sham.


[P]
I have lingering PTSD from years of abuse that my friends don't know about. Because of this, sometimes I react in unexpected ways at their behavior, then they laugh at it or jokingly chastise me for it. I know they mean well and it's not their fault, but it still makes me feel a little hurt, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't want them to feel hyperconscious or bad about it either :/ #uclasecretsfriends #uclasecretsconfessions

So sorry to hear that life had been tough. Let me see if I have your story straight. You feel worthless because of your personality, ie a core part of you that you feel you cannot change. You think that people would not like or want to be friends with you. You probably stick to yourself and not actively try to make friends or you do and you fail. This makes you feel worthless again and continues the loop. Your feels, thoughts, and behavior is conspiring against you. This is a classic example a downward spiral. Please visit CAPS at your next convenience. Once you see your therapist, tell then that you are spiraling. They will help you. Your problem is not small. It is growing but it can be nipped in the bud. You sound motivated to change and really self aware, so I know you can do this!

This is my first year, and I still haven't made friends. Everyone told me over the summer: become BFFs with your roommates, join clubs, make study groups, talk to your floormates, chill with your professors... But my roommates hang out with their high school friends, I don't know anyone in the clubs I go to or my classes, I somehow live on the most antisocial floor on campus, and there's a giant-ass crowd at the end of every class to even talk to my professors. Every time I text someone I barely met, they either ghost me or it turns out they already have plans with their real friends, and I only feel more and more like an annoying acquaintance they're tired of dealing with. I don't think I'll ever have friends like I did in high school, and I'm terrified of being the only loner in what seems to be a truly social campus. #uclasecretsfriends
[S]
I think you should stop this i havent met the one type of mindset. Everyone you meet, in your classes, in your clubs, in your whatever, has the potential to be your friend or best friend. There are some relationships that on paper should've been a match made in heaven for friendship and they should've ended up being each other's best man or bridesmaid. But if you just expect things to fall into place and that friendship to grow then you're wholly mistaken by how friendships are even formed in the first place. There are some friends out there that have nothing in common but still somehow stay friends, because they worked at it, they kept at each other's lives and learned how to be friends with each other.
[S]
Whenever I feel sad or super overwhelmed with life, I go to my professor's office hours and somehow he always makes me feel better. This is why I feel like North Campus professors are better than South Campus ones, because they care about both students' learning and wellbeing. Friends are a great support system too, but sometimes if my friend is having a rough week too, I dont want to unburden myself on her. Therefore, I'm so glad to have found a support system in my professors at UCLA. They really make me want to learn and be a better person too.  #uclasecretsprofessors #uclasecretssupport
[S]
I felt that way too as a freshman (and even part of my sophomore year) but it gets better over time! People can only hang on to their high school friends for so long. It may feel lonely right now but keep trying and eventually you will find people who will want to spend time with you. You're not alone. :)

Recently, I've been having to tell myself to not make permanent decisions based on hopefully temporary feelings. I've been having to tell that to myself every single day lately.

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

He claimed that he wanted to talk to me about a club he was in. I obliged to a dinner at a dining hall. He was a true conversationalist, but he was bitter. He had hatred in the way he talked about humans, and he was hung up about the past. Somehow we ended up in my floor's lounge, and he started making moves on me. He slid his hand down my leg. I didn't do anything. I was shocked. At that point I was naive and did not know to put my guard up around guys. I just wanted to talk. He manipulated me into my room. We had sex. I didn't want to. This began two surreal months, as I continued to sleep with my abuser and I became more and more depressed and stuck in an abusive spiral. He was obsessed with a past girl that he had slept with. She had a boyfriend then. He probably manipulated her too. He would talk about how she was the one, how she was his soulmate, and I would listen. He claimed she was still into him. I don't know why I did, but I tried hard to empathize with him as I hurt inside. He put me down, he belittled my abilities, my opinions, and idealist tendencies. He had delusions of grandeur. He was going to be one of the greats, he would leave a legacy on humanity. He thought everyone was stupid. He once flashed and held a pocket knife against throat as I struggled against him. It was just a joke. I finally broke in the end. I told him I can't do this anymore. He didn't say anything. He raped me again that night. #metoo #uclasecretsrape

People told me to think my recent relationship as a good experience and learn from it. It is true and I should, but I cannot stop wishing I never met the person. All of the memories I can remember are painful and sorrowful. I get angry on how I was treated and to think how much the person is enjoying life. You know, I should've never met you. I don't need the memories, just get away from my life please. I told you I am happy that I met you - sorry now to think of it without the love I once had, you were just a very very bad person in my life.  #uclasecretsmemories #uclasecretsrelationships

Acquiring true friends takes a lot of work. Most people don't take the time to filter out those who really don't fit their life. So, I would recommend taking a close look at your acquaintences and figure out who you think would add value to your life. Then, carefully but frequently, invite them personally (not an email or text) to get together with you for a meal or a drink. Then, when you're together, focus exclusively on that person. Ask about their interests, their likes and dislikes etc. If they ask about you, answer simply without long explanations. They will react very positively to that experience and you'll be well on your way to creating a very special bond with them. If you see a guy to whom you are attracted, just be very nice to him and he'll soon get the idea that you're interested. Good luck!

U are a very brave and strong person who stood up and talked to your mom and brother about it. I have helped many people in past recovering from these kind of situations. If you need assistance feel free to get in touch. Remember better late than never. You have a long long life to go.

Being an underachiever, I can't tell how much the Simpsons episode 'Bart Gets An F' gets to me whenever I watch it. Studying all night and stocked on adderall in a ridiculously competitive class, I go to the final thinking that I'm going to ace it and this is literally the very best that I can do, that I cannot top this performance. Maybe my parents will understand that. I come out of the final and feel satisfied about it, and am pretty happy I got done with it after all this hardwork. Then I get to when the results are announced, in a week or two. I barely come near an 80 and with the curve I'm lucky so I get a B-. What do I say? What did I do wrong? I did everything I could, but here I am. Interviewers will look at this and spout the usual but if you're really interested in the material, it would show in your grades or at least make that face when they see your GPA. Is it my poor attention? I'm not sure, but when things like this keep subtly telling you that you're disappointing, it starts to get to you. I never got close to a 3.5, heck even a 3.2. IFYP Bart

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

I seek solace in reading success stories of people who had rough circumstances but managed to be really successful in the end. I do this because I graduated with a 2.5 GPA & no internships from UCLA and I occasionally I have that depressing day when all I could think about are all the opportunities that are lost and can no longer pursue (grad school....). I made my mistakes back in the day, but today, I am much more mature and I have come to learn that the true recipe to any form of success is self-discipline. A combination of lack of discipline and having no clue what future I wanted for myself is what put me into this mess. Don't be like me and screw up, because you'll certainly run into roadblocks and work much harder in the end (and have depressing days like me today lol). Study, even if you don't feel like it; go workout, even if you don't feel like it; go to office hours, even if you don't feel like it. It's ALWAYS going to be a battle between that voice inside your head saying, I can do it later, and you, the TRUE decision maker. Try to think of that voice in your head as if it was someone else trying to tell you what to do and doing the complete opposite because you ain't no lil bitch and nobody is going to tell you what to do but you lol. Reaching a true level self-discipline means being able to ignore that voice in your head that is constantly saying maybe later and instead getting to work and putting in 200% of your effort into it, even if you feel like utter crap doing it. Forget about motivation too--motivation is fleeting and fickle, discipline is dependable and reliable. Finally, although not completely related, but here's my favorite quote for the past few weeks: “It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” (stop fkn caring what other people think of you and do whatever makes you feel confident and great...but also never forget to always be nice to other people haha) uclasecretsthoughts

What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

Can anyone give me some advice: I am a 4th year MIMG major with a 3.0GPA. I've always wanted to become a doctor. I used to be a great student until I came to UCLA. I used to know how to manage time, I used to know how to get great test scores.. And now I am empty because I feel that I am a different person. I feel I have no way of getting into med school with my 3.0 GPA while fellow classmates have 3.8's with stellar MCAT scores applying. All I have are a few volunteering experiences and 3 years of experience working as an employee in Reagan MC. I haven't even taken MCATS because I feel like I won't even qualify, and it will set me back about $5-10k for med school expenses to end up not getting accepted. Any advice, comments, experiences welcome #uclasecretsadvice

AAMC provides financial aid thru their Finacial Assistance Program that gives you reduced price in MCAT fees and free year subscription for MSAR (provides full admission stats for med schools). For your grade, look into post bacc/SMP/master programs!! Each program have their pros and cons, but you pretty much need to prove that you can handle a full academic load AND do well. I'm recent physiology major grad who graduated and currently enrolled at CSULA's academic enhancer post bacc. I'm doing really well and will most likely raise my gpa by 0.2!!! It's ok to take time and get it right, even if you already graduated. Good luck to you and anyone else

I mentally buried and justified my molester for over ten years because I didn't want to believe that I was a person who could be repeatedly molested. Hey, maybe he was just tickling me. Well, it's not as bad as rape, so I can't tell anyone about it. I'm sure he didn't mean any harm, right? Now I'm suffering the effects of those justifications as I try to piece together my memories and move on.  #uclasecretssupport

This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

I'm sorry this has happened to you write. It is really hard to recover when you've trusted and opened up to therapists only to be let down in the end. I am in a similar situation with my psychologist. Took me ages to trust him, opened up to him about stuff I've never talked about to anyone else, cried myself through very difficult therapy, only for him to throw it all back in my face. He knows I have trust issues especially when it comes to men, because of my past, and he proved me right. I really don't know how you can move on from this, I'm hoping to meet up with an advocate after I've finished treatment to try and find a way forward. Not the same when the trust has gone though is it? I hope you can sort something out xxxx

When do people usually meet their best friends or even friends in college? I'm also a second year and still haven't met mine and I feel like my loneliness is affecting my mental health a lot. #uclasecretslonely
[S]
I think you should stop this i havent met the one type of mindset. Everyone you meet, in your classes, in your clubs, in your whatever, has the potential to be your friend or best friend. There are some relationships that on paper should've been a match made in heaven for friendship and they should've ended up being each other's best man or bridesmaid. But if you just expect things to fall into place and that friendship to grow then you're wholly mistaken by how friendships are even formed in the first place. There are some friends out there that have nothing in common but still somehow stay friends, because they worked at it, they kept at each other's lives and learned how to be friends with each other.
[S]
First, I am so sorry that you are going through this. I have dealt with many similar feelings that you are going through right now. In the past I’ve struggled to have a sense of self-worth and self-confidence, and though I have gotten better these feelings still persist to an extent today. Second, I want to assure you that things, though will take time, will get better, even if you may not feel so. Trust me, I’ve felt that way a lot too, where I thought things would not get better. But as long as you try to make things better, even if they are small steps, trust me, they will get better. Lastly, I want to assure you that you are worthy of being here, and no one deserves to feel how you are feeling. Please feel free to message me if you want to talk. Also I encourage you to try out CAPS, but I understand if you don’t find it helpful (I personally didn’t find it that helpful for me as I prefer to talk to friends or at least peers about my problems).
[S]
It is very brave of you to share the bad things happened to you and expressed your emotion entirely. Childhood does have a big influence on your mental health. You are not alone, many people have gone through Cal with depression, like me as a psych major. i was lucky to have friends who know about depression or went through similar problems together. not everyone could understand symptoms of depression and say things to make u feel better, but they do want to help you (except your Dad who might make it worse) try to talk to anyone from psych major, im sure they are, or even i am, happy to talk with you. Make good use of Tang Center, and campus counselling services like Student to Student Peer Counselling, they are on phone or in person. :) Go little Cal Bear, you will be great!

Last Thanksgiving my cousin's new wife, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white girl called me and the rest of my Mexican family racist cuz we said white privilege exists. It takes a lot of white privilege to be white and call minorities racist. #cringegiving.

First mistake: when you're being involved with the community and other work opportunities it should be because you're personally interested in participating not for a resume boost!! Second mistake: you're privilege just to have the opportunity to study at a UC when many other people don't. But glad you made the best of your situation and found "happiness" wherever you be at. Go Bears!!!

While you have no reason to listen to this, you don't know me and you seem to be very set in your decision, please don't kill yourself. Depression and anhedonia are terrible, and living with them is horrible but please give it some more time. This is a brain injury, not unlike a concussion or a stroke and it takes time to heal. The brain is incredibly slow at healing itself. It often takes months and several different medications before you find the right one to mitigate the symptoms for you. Please, just don't give up so soon. While memory loss is better than suicide, the possibility of being able to feel happiness is even better than that. Just a little more time OP, for your friends, your family, but most importantly for yourself. You can get through this. Let the people around you support you and if you need more than that, we can change the first sentence I said and you can message me. I'm no one special, just willing to be a friend if you need another.
[S]
Honestly, it takes a lot to get good grades here. If you have any sort of social life or a job, I'm amazed if you do well. I stress out and have mini breakdowns every quarter.. just do your best and don't let it kill you. Also, don't snort the adderall.. I know it's more fun, but it doesn't work the way it is supposed to if you snort it.. hope that helps. Lol.

I had a lovely Thanksgiving with my family until my mom brought up how Die Hard was her favorite Christmas movie. We spent literally an hour and a half in an argument over whether or not it is a holiday movie (it totally is), which ended in my family and I storming out of my cousin's house. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! #CringeGiving.

To the well-dressed boy who approached me at the edge of Washington Square Park on November 6th: I've never had anyone run after me just to politely introduce themselves, tell me they noticed me walking through the park, and that I looked pretty — that might just be one of the sweetest encounters with a stranger I've ever had. I was actually having an overwhelmingly stressful day, and your thoughtful gesture really cheered me up! I greatly admire your courage (bolder than anything I could ever manage) and appreciate how courteous you were throughout our short conversation. Usually the type of guy to approach me is a serious creep, an asian fetishist, or someone who makes me feel unsafe walking around at night, so it was incredibly refreshing to meet someone so genuine and endearing. As I mentioned (and I hope you didn't think I was lying to try to get out of anything), I do have a boyfriend of 4 years, and didn't feel it was appropriate to give you my number or stay in contact in any way. But I just felt horrible for leaving so suddenly (I was flustered and thought it was a prank/dare!) and wanted to get this message to you somehow. You seemed like a stellar guy and, objectively, you are also super good looking! Your next girlfriend found a keeper! Wishing you the best.

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

Guess our professor forgot about daylight savings, cuz he took a look at his watch at 1 and said all right, looks like we're out of time! (class ends at 2) The entire class just looked at each other with that do we tell him look, then we all got up and left and honestly I've never felt this level of community at NYU ever before.

Pretty sure OP is talking about the Anime class I'm in. I was so surprised when no one said anything. I guess the last 30 minutes of magical-schoolgirl-in-Feudal-China shojo were enough to crush everyone's spirit lmao.

AAMC provides financial aid thru their Finacial Assistance Program that gives you reduced price in MCAT fees and free year subscription for MSAR (provides full admission stats for med schools). For your grade, look into post bacc/SMP/master programs!! Each program have their pros and cons, but you pretty much need to prove that you can handle a full academic load AND do well. I'm recent physiology major grad who graduated and currently enrolled at CSULA's academic enhancer post bacc. I'm doing really well and will most likely raise my gpa by 0.2!!! It's ok to take time and get it right, even if you already graduated. Good luck to you and anyone else
[S]
Act as if you suspect nothing. You don't have any 'ammunition' to use to do anything other than trying your best to get through the class and into another professor's class who will likely also do the same. Life is the way it is and it is difficult to change individually. Most individuals in a postion to do something are unwilling to go out on a limb so they perpetuate the discrimination. Take a deep breath and plug on. You'll be ok.

can someone please explain what purpose nyu's multi factor authentication is supposed to serve besides being really frustrating.

Honestly, it takes a lot to get good grades here. If you have any sort of social life or a job, I'm amazed if you do well. I stress out and have mini breakdowns every quarter.. just do your best and don't let it kill you. Also, don't snort the adderall.. I know it's more fun, but it doesn't work the way it is supposed to if you snort it.. hope that helps. Lol.

You are a young adult and need your own space, especially with going to med school. You might need to sit down with mom and have a heart to heart talk with her. Explain how difficult med school is and the amount of work required to be successful. She might also need to come to realize that all work and no play is a formula for failure. Remember it is her house and she is doubling as a landlord. It is a difficult situation for both of you.Perhaps you can agree on some things you can do around the house that would be acceptable to both of you. Be firm , loving and prepared when you approach her. Be sure to choose a good time for both of you where you are both relaxed and open to the conversation.

Went to the doctor today and apparently I have all of the symptoms (obvious and messed known) of being pregnant. Waiting for the bloodwork. Checked recently about my thyroid so that's not the issue. I feel like I should be freaking out because it's literally impossible for me to be pregnant but honestly I'm more excited to see how much it would freak a bunch of racists out to find out that Jesus came from an Asian.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

Last weekend, I hosted a halloween party, when friends went into my room to get something, found my American Whopper dildo instead, brought it outside into the living room and started tossing it around. By the end of the night, people were using it as microphones, trying to get the suction end to stick on the ceiling, and covering it in glitter makeup. It was all fine, until the next day, I noticed it was gone. My roommates and I turned our entire apartment upside down, and we still couldn't find it. it's been a week now, and we still have no idea where it is. Tl;dr Somebody stole my dildo, and I have no idea what to do with my life now.

I like when my boyfriend calls me mommy in bed. Makes me feel like I'm finally the one in control... is that something I should be ashamed of? Like it's not about my mom or anything, just a feeling i get, you know?
[S]
That is unfortunate that your family isn't giving you the support you need. Sexual assaults are the lowest reported crimes because the victim is often ashamed or embarrassed. It is not your fault, people who sexually assault others are the scum of the earth. I was molested when I was a child and still get haunted from it even though it happened almost 10 years ago. It has affected me ever since it happened and will more than likely be that way forever. It isn't something that is easy to forget. My advice for you is to join support groups and talk about it, get your feelings out and try to become comfortable with them. I know talking about it brings up the memories, but it helps. I'd be willing to talk if you ever wanted to. Try to keep your head up.
[S]
just tell them. Like you could say something like Hey I like jokes, but that one about death is just inappropriate. its awkward at first. But letting them know is better than leaving them in ignorance and you feeling uncomfortable.
[S]
I feel okay. Like John Nash, I accept that my hallucinations are not real. They are not real people. So I can let them disappear in the distance. Do you think you could be projecting your feeings about breaking up with the child's mom onto the boy ?? Transferring your feelings onto a 7 month old baby is truly bad for the child. This is your son and he looks up to you. He is the wellspring of love. Let that love infect your being.  Adjusting to the idea that you are a parent for life, that is a big adjustment. No wonder you can't eat or sleep, this was a surprise for you, not a planned event.

I particularly find the one with black hair kind of cute, and I keep seeing him around but I never get a chance to strike up a conversation with him that lasts for longer than 30 seconds. I didn't even get to ask for his name. Please help a girl out, im just tryna find love

What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

Hey Friend! You've lost a lot of weight since I last saw you and now I'm really worried. I think you need to get professional help ASAP. I not doing anything until seven, so can we walk in together? We can grab some dinner together afterwards too.

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.


[P]
As a man, I have been sexually assaulted by a woman in the past. I have wanted to join the #MeToo movement for some time now, but I'm afraid I'll be ridiculed or berated. Every time I have told a friend about my experience I have always been told “It's not a big deal, she was probably just messing around” or “well if she was hot, then why is it a problem?” Sexual assault is sexual assault, and I should be able to come clean about my experiences without being told they're not real.
[S]
That is unfortunate that your family isn't giving you the support you need. Sexual assaults are the lowest reported crimes because the victim is often ashamed or embarrassed. It is not your fault, people who sexually assault others are the scum of the earth. I was molested when I was a child and still get haunted from it even though it happened almost 10 years ago. It has affected me ever since it happened and will more than likely be that way forever. It isn't something that is easy to forget. My advice for you is to join support groups and talk about it, get your feelings out and try to become comfortable with them. I know talking about it brings up the memories, but it helps. I'd be willing to talk if you ever wanted to. Try to keep your head up.
[S]
What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't.

If the therapy isn't working, then start running around the campus. Run to Wilshire, and then back up Veteran if you have to. Make strategic Spotify playlists to lift your mood while you run. It's good to run in the morning, and gaze at the horizon. Anhedonia is just apathy and insatiability, it's common to feel this way. You can tap into your subtle body and stimulate that which you're repressing. The brain is malleable, and nerves can heal themselves. Steve Jobs did acid to btw.

You talk about yourself as a decent person with decent qualities, but likeable is not one of them. Would you find yourself likeable at all? Could you expect people to like you if you imagine scenarios of people not liking you, as you are in effect actively finding reasons to not like yourself? Are you being too hard on yourself by defining likeable as having the approval of people who will genuinely like me, text me, and email me whenever I message them? Is it more assumable to think that keeping to yourself too much is making it hard for people to find things in common with you?
[S]
Give yourself permission to take a break! You are a lovely individual and your major (and uni as a whole, really) wants you to feel your major is your only source of worth. Please continue to do the good and wonderful work that you do. But schedule (please for the love of everything, schedule it so you can look forward to it!) five hours a week to watch that new show with friends, do that dance workshop, joke with the wine club, and reclaim your personality.

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

Growing up, my parents at best, were emotionally neglectful and at worst, emotionally abusive. Since then, I've been forced to fend for myself in terms of providing myself emotional and mental support. I'm thankful they're paying for my college education but I sometimes wish they weren't. Aside from supporting me financially, which I greatly appreciate and am so thankful for, they constantly berate me, are condescending, and blame me for things that aren't my fault. I wish I could cut them off, but I know that I can't. Is it bad I'm sticking around just for the free tuition?
[S]
Im a flaming feminist and Im here for you. This system hurts men and doesn't allow them much emotional release. A feminist who wants to see a better world realizes the pain of everyone. I'm sorry if others have made you feel discounted. There are so many opinions out there these days it's hard for good ones to be heard. I hope others don't discourage you from telling your story. I wish you peace

You have been in this position a long time and it will feel shocking to you to be assertive with her. She is being very selfish. Your school work is work enough. When she is verbally abusive to you, you are old enough now to stop pleasing her and tell her instead that you do not deserve to be treated that way. And walk out of the house after you tell her that you do not deserve to be treated that way. Do not do the chores if she verbally abuses you. If you treat me that way, I won't help you at all. You can stand up to her. You are not her little girl anymore. Doing this will feel foreign to you. But she is being very bossy and unkind to a perfect daughter. I tried to get my mother's understanding and approval for years before I realized I wasn't going to get it.

I hate my body. It faces a wage gap, underrepresentation in corporate boardrooms and poliitics, and stigma in society. Little kids watch Disney movies grow up learning that main characters don't look like me. Adults watch movies learning that, too.

Whenever I feel sad or super overwhelmed with life, I go to my professor's office hours and somehow he always makes me feel better. This is why I feel like North Campus professors are better than South Campus ones, because they care about both students' learning and wellbeing. Friends are a great support system too, but sometimes if my friend is having a rough week too, I dont want to unburden myself on her. Therefore, I'm so glad to have found a support system in my professors at UCLA. They really make me want to learn and be a better person too.  #uclasecretsprofessors #uclasecretssupport

Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

I feel okay. Like John Nash, I accept that my hallucinations are not real. They are not real people. So I can let them disappear in the distance. Do you think you could be projecting your feeings about breaking up with the child's mom onto the boy ?? Transferring your feelings onto a 7 month old baby is truly bad for the child. This is your son and he looks up to you. He is the wellspring of love. Let that love infect your being.  Adjusting to the idea that you are a parent for life, that is a big adjustment. No wonder you can't eat or sleep, this was a surprise for you, not a planned event.

That is a terrible way to grow up! However, it is now your choice as to how you want it to affect your life. You can be a victim forever if you choose. Or, you can get it behind you if you choose. I think you should seek professional assistance and over time, put your past behind you and be the courageous, trusting woman you were meant to be. And, don’t be afraid to talk about your past and don’t be shamed by it. Take a deep breath and take the first step to getting past this.

I read the secret about the Comic Sans font and literally felt stabbed in my heart. This makes me feel like I care too much about aesthetic and reminded me of this: I broke up with my last boyfriend because I met him during the winter but summer came around and he started wearing cargo shorts. I literally felt less attracted to him and couldn't continue on. I feel like I need help because I'm too shallow.

If you prefer someone who takes pride in their appearance there's really nothing wrong with that. A bit harsh, but it's about the line you draw. Yours is at cargo shorts. Other people's may be at simply showering.

This is unfortunately a very common problem nowadays. I've been there. I felt like my family could't recognize me after long periods of isolation in school.

I felt that way too as a freshman (and even part of my sophomore year) but it gets better over time! People can only hang on to their high school friends for so long.

In the past I’ve struggled to have a sense of self-worth and self-confidence, and though I have gotten better these feelings still persist to an extent today. Second, I want to assure you that things, though will take time, will get better, even if you may not feel so. Trust me, I’ve felt that way a lot too, where I thought things would not get better. But as long as you try to make things better, even if they are small steps, trust me, they will get better. Lastly, I want to assure you that you are worthy of being here, and no one deserves to feel how you are feeling. Please feel free to message me if you want to talk. Also I encourage you to try out CAPS, but I understand if you don’t find it helpful (I personally didn’t find it that helpful for me as I prefer to talk to friends or at least peers about my problems).

I think my bobst crush finished midterms and I'm low-key kind of upset

the fact that the other person reached out to you is a good sign!! sometimes u just gotta remind them casually like Hey u wanna grab dinner this wk? etc. also perhaps theyre busy with midterms but little gestures like that i definitely appreciate :)

What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

When I got into Berkeley, I was extremely excited and felt as though I deserved my admission based on my hard work in HS. However, when I actually got to Berkeley, I realized that the majority of my peers are WAAAAY smarter than me....but, who cares?? You got in, stick out your four years, and get UC Berkeley under your belt. I thought the admissions committee was on crack for accepting me after I finished my first semester, but I stuck it out. You obviously have something in you that makes you worthy of being a golden bear. Perseverance is all it takes.. (BTW, I had to look up how to spell "perseverance") :) You got this!

I said a dude was handsome once like 2 weeks ago and now all my friends are literally pressuring me into being gay. They say things like maybe you just don't know it yet or why don't you just try it?. Um maybe cuz I don't like men? I know they're trying to be supportive especially in this new social climate but enough is enough. I know I'm def not the most masculine guy and I've def had people mistake me for gay before, but if I say I'm not gay I'm not fucking gay and people need to stop needling me about it.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

I found out I had genital herpes the other day. I went home last weekend crying and told my mother, who is my best friend, that I thought my life was over and that I'd never orgasm ever again. Today, I got an email from my dorm that I had a package. My mother sent me a vibrator.

You have been in this position a long time and it will feel shocking to you to be assertive with her. She is being very selfish. Your school work is work enough. When she is verbally abusive to you, you are old enough now to stop pleasing her and tell her instead that you do not deserve to be treated that way. And walk out of the house after you tell her that you do not deserve to be treated that way. Do not do the chores if she verbally abuses you. If you treat me that way, I won't help you at all. You can stand up to her. You are not her little girl anymore. Doing this will feel foreign to you. But she is being very bossy and unkind to a perfect daughter. I tried to get my mother's understanding and approval for years before I realized I wasn't going to get it.

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

I'm a straight guy and I'm legitimately confused as to what I'm supposed to be doing to support feminism in response to the me too movement. I feel like if I continue to just listen like they ask me to do then I get scrutinized for not taking any action, but then when I try to speak out in favor of faminsim, or actively try to promote the ideals and beliefs, I'm seen as a pseudo-feminist who isn't really able to understand what I'm talking about. I've talked to my female friends about ideas that I have to try to make a change and all I get is conflicting opinions saying that I shouldn't try to do anything as it would draw attention away from what matters, but then I constantly hear that it's time for men to do something. That's all I want to do, is to do something that will show women that men understand and are there to help without coming off as fake or taking the attention away from the issue at hand. Women, I'm on your side and I want to do something, but I just don't know what to do.
[S]
So sorry to hear that life had been tough. Let me see if I have your story straight. You feel worthless because of your personality, ie a core part of you that you feel you cannot change. You think that people would not like or want to be friends with you. You probably stick to yourself and not actively try to make friends or you do and you fail. This makes you feel worthless again and continues the loop. Your feels, thoughts, and behavior is conspiring against you. This is a classic example a downward spiral. Please visit CAPS at your next convenience. Once you see your therapist, tell then that you are spiraling. They will help you. Your problem is not small. It is growing but it can be nipped in the bud. You sound motivated to change and really self aware, so I know you can do this!

My brother killed himself a few years ago. I don't keep track of the date. But losing a child is a whole nother level of heartbreak. I know I was devastated when my GF lost our baby at 3 months. But having actually having had known him and loving him for so many years then losing him cannot be easy. Just try and remember the good times you shared.

I'm a Jew and I'm pro-Palestine. As much as I want to get involved with SJP, I can't because my family will disown me. I wish that more people would realize how intertwined this issue has become to Judaism itself. In hebrew school, we learned that Palestinians were evil murderers. Anyone who even asked for the other side of the story was severely punished. I hate that I feel like I have to choose between my Jewish identity and my political beliefs.

I just met a woman who graduated from UCSF med school after completing her MPH at Johns Hopkins. BUT she did all of that after taking 4 gap years because she graduated from UCLA with a 2.6 GPA. In those gap years she worked on research that she was really passionate about. As long as you pursue your passions and really show growth in your gap years, anything is possible. If you really want to be a doctor, you will be. Perseverance is the epitome of the medical journey. Good luck, stay strong, and stay motivated. You'll get there. and. don't. compare. yourself. to. others.

You are a young adult and need your own space, especially with going to med school. You might need to sit down with mom and have a heart to heart talk with her. Explain how difficult med school is and the amount of work required to be successful. She might also need to come to realize that all work and no play is a formula for failure. Remember it is her house and she is doubling as a landlord. It is a difficult situation for both of you.Perhaps you can agree on some things you can do around the house that would be acceptable to both of you. Be firm , loving and prepared when you approach her. Be sure to choose a good time for both of you where you are both relaxed and open to the conversation.

Whenever I feel sad or super overwhelmed with life, I go to my professor's office hours and somehow he always makes me feel better. This is why I feel like North Campus professors are better than South Campus ones, because they care about both students' learning and wellbeing. Friends are a great support system too, but sometimes if my friend is having a rough week too, I dont want to unburden myself on her. Therefore, I'm so glad to have found a support system in my professors at UCLA. They really make me want to learn and be a better person too.  #uclasecretsprofessors #uclasecretssupport

First mistake: when you're being involved with the community and other work opportunities it should be because you're personally interested in participating not for a resume boost!! Second mistake: you're privilege just to have the opportunity to study at a UC when many other people don't. But glad you made the best of your situation and found "happiness" wherever you be at. Go Bears!!!

I was drunk at a friend's house. Her roommate - a boy - offered to take me upstairs to his bedroom so I could sleep. He said he would sleep on the couch downstairs. But still, I wouldn't go with him until my other friend - a girl - went with me to make sure I was ok. In the morning, I woke up and almost apologized to my friend's roommate because I felt I had made him feel awkward. But I didn't apologize to him. While I'm sure he had no intention to harm me, I had no guarantee of that because as a woman, I've been conditioned to fear men's actions. I'm thankful for my friend's roommate for being kind. He's a sweet guy. But if I had a dollar for every time a sweet guy turned out to be not so sweet, well, I'd obviously be very, very rich. No more apology culture. Men, you've made this name for yourselves. Now fucking fix it.

This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

I feel okay. Like John Nash, I accept that my hallucinations are not real. They are not real people. So I can let them disappear in the distance. Do you think you could be projecting your feeings about breaking up with the child's mom onto the boy ?? Transferring your feelings onto a 7 month old baby is truly bad for the child. This is your son and he looks up to you. He is the wellspring of love. Let that love infect your being.  Adjusting to the idea that you are a parent for life, that is a big adjustment. No wonder you can't eat or sleep, this was a surprise for you, not a planned event.

I know it seems tough now --- but it will get better pretty quickly. Just keep your eyes open as you walk through the campus and I'm sure you'll see a number of women who will take your mind off of your last girlfriend.

[S]
I think you should stop this i havent met the one type of mindset. Everyone you meet, in your classes, in your clubs, in your whatever, has the potential to be your friend or best friend. There are some relationships that on paper should've been a match made in heaven for friendship and they should've ended up being each other's best man or bridesmaid. But if you just expect things to fall into place and that friendship to grow then you're wholly mistaken by how friendships are even formed in the first place. There are some friends out there that have nothing in common but still somehow stay friends, because they worked at it, they kept at each other's lives and learned how to be friends with each other.

My professor asked my class if anyone wants to teach her morning class so she can get drunk tonight. I'm inspired.
[S]
Act as if you suspect nothing. You don't have any 'ammunition' to use to do anything other than trying your best to get through the class and into another professor's class who will likely also do the same. Life is the way it is and it is difficult to change individually. Most individuals in a postion to do something are unwilling to go out on a limb so they perpetuate the discrimination. Take a deep breath and plug on. You'll be ok.

Why do you want good grades? Grades are just one of the indicators for how well you know the material of a class. It was designed to fit everybody, so in reality it fits no one. It is by far not the only indicator for how good you are in your field. It's up to you how much importance you want to prescribe to it. I was never a great studier or a fast learner, so I had a lower GPA than most of my friends. But for me, school wasn't about grades. School was an opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn, and a degree was just a stepping stone to future jobs. So I didn't stress so much about my grades, paid attention to the classes I liked, and focused the rest of my energy on personal projects. I never even put my GPA on my resume, my projects filled the gap, and I landed decent internships (tho some companies did ask for my GPA. I stopped caring about such closed-minded companies). Point is, there are so many other ways to get a job, like networking or doing research or getting recs. School isn't all about grades, it means whatever you want it to mean. So figure out what you want to get out of it, focus on what you're good at, and don't waste your four years trying to meet other people's standards.

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

I think you should stop this i havent met the one type of mindset. Everyone you meet, in your classes, in your clubs, in your whatever, has the potential to be your friend or best friend. There are some relationships that on paper should've been a match made in heaven for friendship and they should've ended up being each other's best man or bridesmaid. But if you just expect things to fall into place and that friendship to grow then you're wholly mistaken by how friendships are even formed in the first place. There are some friends out there that have nothing in common but still somehow stay friends, because they worked at it, they kept at each other's lives and learned how to be friends with each other.

I had sex on my roommate's bed and basically my partner and I both came all over my roommate's un-sheeted pillow. I re-covered his pillow and last night my roommate mentioned that his pillow smelled especially nice for some reason, oops
[S]
This was me last year but you should talk to your roommate more.
[S]
When you said she saved your life several times, it seems like a red flag. Maybe she wanted to be a partner, not a savior.
[S]
...The good news: it's even simpler than that. Obviously it'll vary based on the circumstances some, but basically you just have to fill out the readmission application, talk to an adviser, and make a contract about how many classes you can take and when and what grades you need to achieve, etc. ... And then you enroll in your classes like usual (usually through UNEX in what's called concurrent enrollment) and move on. **Disclaimer: I am not an academic adviser... I just have far, far too much personal experience with this. XD**

i'm too scared to post that on my actual facebook because i'm still facebook friends with the guy and i know he doesn't remember that day the same way i do

It is very brave of you to share the bad things happened to you and expressed your emotion entirely. Childhood does have a big influence on your mental health. You are not alone, many people have gone through Cal with depression, like me as a psych major. i was lucky to have friends who know about depression or went through similar problems together. not everyone could understand symptoms of depression and say things to make u feel better, but they do want to help you (except your Dad who might make it worse) try to talk to anyone from psych major, im sure they are, or even i am, happy to talk with you. Make good use of Tang Center, and campus counselling services like Student to Student Peer Counselling, they are on phone or in person. :) Go little Cal Bear, you will be great!
[S]
all these false priests and charlatan of eCONomists use their unrealistic assumptions like perfect rationality and self interested actors to maintain the dominance of the rootless capitalist rent seekers by spreading the twisted sick dogma of neoliberalism. there was this one time i read an article on behavioral economics so it's pretty clear to me the whole field is a sham.
[S]
the fact that the other person reached out to you is a good sign!! sometimes u just gotta remind them casually like Hey u wanna grab dinner this wk? etc. also perhaps theyre busy with midterms but little gestures like that i definitely appreciate :)

I got into a section of a language class where everyone else is from the same class beforehand, and I'm not into side talks during class (it wastes the professor's time, and my money that I'm paying for the class). So I made a brilliant plan of doing a social experiment where I act like a complete asshole Sternie stereotype just in that class to gauge my classmates' reactions, like making all my answers business related. It's been entertaining as hell so far. I noticed that LS and Tisch students react/laugh at me the most, where CAS students are the most neutral. I look forward for my class every day to be the best asshole. It's fantastic.
[S]
Act as if you suspect nothing. You don't have any 'ammunition' to use to do anything other than trying your best to get through the class and into another professor's class who will likely also do the same. Life is the way it is and it is difficult to change individually. Most individuals in a postion to do something are unwilling to go out on a limb so they perpetuate the discrimination. Take a deep breath and plug on. You'll be ok.

Pretty sure OP is talking about the Anime class I'm in. I was so surprised when no one said anything. I guess the last 30 minutes of magical-schoolgirl-in-Feudal-China shojo were enough to crush everyone's spirit lmao.

A few months ago, I was sexually assaulted. I was heartbroken, disappointed and for some time, unsure of how to cope. Long story short, I decided to channel my anger and sadness into many of the mental health/wellness initiatives I've launched through this page, in the hopes that they would maybe help someone who had experienced something similar. If you've ever been sexually harassed, sexually assaulted or raped, please know that you're never alone, that time heals all wounds, and that help is out there.
[S]
That is unfortunate that your family isn't giving you the support you need. Sexual assaults are the lowest reported crimes because the victim is often ashamed or embarrassed. It is not your fault, people who sexually assault others are the scum of the earth. I was molested when I was a child and still get haunted from it even though it happened almost 10 years ago. It has affected me ever since it happened and will more than likely be that way forever. It isn't something that is easy to forget. My advice for you is to join support groups and talk about it, get your feelings out and try to become comfortable with them. I know talking about it brings up the memories, but it helps. I'd be willing to talk if you ever wanted to. Try to keep your head up.
[S]
That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

Fml right now. I've been slacking off in school for the past four years because I thought that one day I would inherit close to a billion dollars in assets from my dad. Come to find out the fool just had another child at the age of 67 with his 20 year old mistress, who I am now probably going to share my inheritance with. Now instead of everything going to me it's more than likely going to be split three ways. This is so messed up, idk what to do.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

First, I am so sorry that you are going through this. I have dealt with many similar feelings that you are going through right now. In the past I’ve struggled to have a sense of self-worth and self-confidence, and though I have gotten better these feelings still persist to an extent today. Second, I want to assure you that things, though will take time, will get better, even if you may not feel so. Trust me, I’ve felt that way a lot too, where I thought things would not get better. But as long as you try to make things better, even if they are small steps, trust me, they will get better. Lastly, I want to assure you that you are worthy of being here, and no one deserves to feel how you are feeling. Please feel free to message me if you want to talk. Also I encourage you to try out CAPS, but I understand if you don’t find it helpful (I personally didn’t find it that helpful for me as I prefer to talk to friends or at least peers about my problems).

In my culture, it's standard for a son to give his first month's payment to his mom. I live at home and it's something my older brother did, and so did my dad with his mom. It honestly felt pretty crappy to do the wire transfer, since my parents recently just spend money freely and I know they're just going to use it to buy some more shit we don't need. I'm scared that this first payment will become standard, as proof that I am capable of continuously paying for my parents while I live under their roof. I'm even more scared I'll never be able to save up enough (exactly why I stayed at home in the first place after graduating) to move out somewhere worthwhile. Why should I feel obligated to do so much more for my parents than they ever did for theirs?. (This secret was brought to you by daddy issues)

Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up.

I'm a commuter student and I live with my parents in their apartment on the Upper East Side. Last night, I brought home my boyfriend, thinking my parents wouldn't be home until late. After a few drinks, me and the guy start hooking up in the living room and things get really steamy. Literally the moment I yell out Oh yes, daddy! the front door swings open and my father, who doesn't know I'm gay walks in. We haven't spoken since. FML.

If you were ever thinking about taking exams at the Moses center, I discourage you to do so. The environment is horrible and you are constantly being watched on cameras. They have falsely accused me of cheating twice. Their justification? I dropped a napkin and that apparently looked suspicious on cameras. I now have to deal with a number of staff members to prove my innocence. How are they helping people with learning disabilities if all they are doing is alleviating anxiety? The same goes for the Wellness exchange. The amount of times I have been dismissed, told to sleep on it etc. Seriously NYU. If you were easier to sue, I would be a fucking billionaire.

If the therapy isn't working, then start running around the campus. Run to Wilshire, and then back up Veteran if you have to. Make strategic Spotify playlists to lift your mood while you run. It's good to run in the morning, and gaze at the horizon. Anhedonia is just apathy and insatiability, it's common to feel this way. You can tap into your subtle body and stimulate that which you're repressing. The brain is malleable, and nerves can heal themselves. Steve Jobs did acid to btw.

I am so sorry for what you and your family have experienced. I haven't had that type of experience, but I have suffered from PTSD. The more you talk about it, the better.

It sounds like God heard you. I believe if you ask Him to help you overcome the trauma, He'll hear you again and answer. I was led to speak to a counselor, and they helped tremendously. Then I continued to attend seminars to learn more about overcoming my past. It's a process, but God is faithful. I've experienced so much healing, and I don't doubt you will as well. Let us know how it goes. We're here with you.

It sounds like God heard you. I believe if you ask Him to help you overcome the trauma, He'll hear you again and answer. I was led to speak to a counselor, and they helped tremendously. Then I continued to attend seminars to learn more about overcoming my past. It's a process, but God is faithful. I've experienced so much healing, and I don't doubt you will as well. Let us know how it goes. We're here with you.

Why do you want good grades? Grades are just one of the indicators for how well you know the material of a class. It was designed to fit everybody, so in reality it fits no one. It is by far not the only indicator for how good you are in your field. It's up to you how much importance you want to prescribe to it. I was never a great studier or a fast learner, so I had a lower GPA than most of my friends. But for me, school wasn't about grades. School was an opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn, and a degree was just a stepping stone to future jobs. So I didn't stress so much about my grades, paid attention to the classes I liked, and focused the rest of my energy on personal projects. I never even put my GPA on my resume, my projects filled the gap, and I landed decent internships (tho some companies did ask for my GPA. I stopped caring about such closed-minded companies). Point is, there are so many other ways to get a job, like networking or doing research or getting recs. School isn't all about grades, it means whatever you want it to mean. So figure out what you want to get out of it, focus on what you're good at, and don't waste your four years trying to meet other people's standards.

I was in my friend's room when I asked him what he was dressing up as for Halloween. He pulls out all of his Stern branded things: water bottle, shirt, hoodie, duffle bag, hat and a couple of stickers. Me: 'you're going as a Sternie?' Him: 'Nah an obnoxious prick'

Whenever I feel sad or super overwhelmed with life, I go to my professor's office hours and somehow he always makes me feel better. This is why I feel like North Campus professors are better than South Campus ones, because they care about both students' learning and wellbeing. Friends are a great support system too, but sometimes if my friend is having a rough week too, I dont want to unburden myself on her. Therefore, I'm so glad to have found a support system in my professors at UCLA. They really make me want to learn and be a better person too.  #uclasecretsprofessors #uclasecretssupport

I would say that it is entirely normal to have 'crushes' it's just just important to be aware that we cannot truly have any more than that as someone looking from a distance. Love can only really come from physical interaction and really knowing a person. Sure, we could obsess over them, but that isn't real because we don't actually know the person; they could be vile in reality, and if we base how we feel about them from the projections they make on social media or in the news, then we only get a filtered version of them, one that is unlikely to reveal any of the bad points about them. So, this would probably fall under 'idealisation' in that you see an ideal person, partly because that is all you're allowed to see and partly because that has become what you want to see. I am guessing that you follow them on social media and the like, so a start would be to break the habit of checking in on them, replacing this behaviour with something else more beneficial. Remind yourself that you don't know that person and that it would be far healthier to focus on 'real world' women and working towards meeting and getting to know someone in that way

To the OP who anonymously sent in a secret last night about a professor who allegedly sexually harassed multiple students who tried reporting it twice to no avail - I just got off the phone with the president's office and a few other people in an attempt to report it. If you feel comfortable, please DM the page for details. Let me know if you have any questions, or if there's anything else I can do to help you. Thanks.
[S]
Kira O'Connor Not sure if it's you but you certainly fit the bill so maybe? also OP, I don't think it's weird. They're students just like you are :P But maybe be careful about asking out the RA if they're for your floor until next year, /just/ in case it goes south.
[S]
I think that particular person might just be that way. Sometimes people get harassed a lot by others propositioning them for sex - it's a defense mechanism to then be mean as a default state. Please don't let this deter you from continuing to hit people up as a friend :)

A random drunk girl climbed in through my open window from my fire escape and asked if she could use my bathroom. Keep in mind that I was ass naked at the time and my fuck buddy was balls deep inside me. She did ask how the sex was, which was nice.

I know it seems tough now --- but it will get better pretty quickly. Just keep your eyes open as you walk through the campus and I'm sure you'll see a number of women who will take your mind off of your last girlfriend. And, be grateful for the fact she broke up earlier rather than later because the longer it goes on, the more difficult it is to get out.
[S]
Act as if you suspect nothing. You don't have any 'ammunition' to use to do anything other than trying your best to get through the class and into another professor's class who will likely also do the same. Life is the way it is and it is difficult to change individually. Most individuals in a postion to do something are unwilling to go out on a limb so they perpetuate the discrimination. Take a deep breath and plug on. You'll be ok.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

My quiet, religiously conservative roommate got a girlfriend a few weeks ago. They hang out in our room a lot which is fine, they're pretty chill, and the first time he asked about her staying over I thought nothing of it, having heard his spiel about his faith and devotion to celibacy until marriage. Fast forward to last night when I wake up at 3am to take a piss, and hear creaking bedsprings and muffled, awkward moans from 5 feet away. Never in my life have I wished harder for a Polaroid camera, because I would've framed the look of sheer horror in his moonlit eyes.

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

Am I the only one who thinks the new security guard at Bobst is super hot? He stands on the left side of the lobby in the morning/ early afternoon looking so damn fine in his uniform, and he's always got that serious ‘I ain't letting anyone in this god damn library without their NYU ID card' face. Now I only enter Bobst from the left side in the morning/afternoon just so I can make eye contact with him.

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

Hi. As someone with a lot of anxiety, I completely get how crappy it feels to start a new job. Trying to learn the job duties along with gauging the personalities of all the new people you are working with can be overwhelming. Its possible that your participation was listed as optional, because they didn't want to make you feel pressured to attend a birthday lunch for/with people you don't know very well. At least that's what it sounds like to me. My company did a secret santa type thing in my department and gave me the option not to participate, due to only having been in this job for about four months or so (and I normally work night shifts so I don't have a ton of interaction with my coworkers). That's just my two cents on the situation, I hope it helps!

I've been dating a girl for almost two years now. I'm a mixed-race POC and she's aryan as fuck. Today, after acting oddly standoffish and squeamish for a few months, she left me, saying that she just couldn't date someone who was non white anymore, because apparently there are things POC can't understand. I'm livid and heartbroken and entirely disappointed. I really thought I was going to spend my life with this girl, and over the span of a few months, she turns into a white nationalist. Why does it take so long for some people's true colors to come out?

My brother killed himself a few years ago. I don't keep track of the date. But losing a child is a whole nother level of heartbreak. I know I was devastated when my GF lost our baby at 3 months. But having actually having had known him and loving him for so many years then losing him cannot be easy. Just try and remember the good times you shared.

Being celibate in this school (and college in general) has been rougher than I anticipated. My friends constantly base conversations on sex stories, and I can't do much else other than nod and smile. People either tease me or respect me for keeping my virginity. Experiences on dating apps haven't been the best, since delayed sex or no sex doesn't sit well with most people. It's come to the point where I don't even want to bother with dating anymore. This isn't a knock on sexually-active people -- all the power to y'all. I don't plan on changing my stance, but I can't help but feeling like an outsider, socially and romantically.

I feel for this women but i have a few questions. Why didnt you stop him in when he ran his hand down your leg?how did he manipulate you to go to your room then have sex ? Then you continued to have sex with him ?? Its not like he forced her to do anything. There seems to be two individuals with issues and problems
[S]
What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!


[P]
Last semester my professor told us during our second to last class that we need to email our final papers to her as class is cancelled because she is having her baby. We all were soooo shook and literally thought she was joking. Plot twist, she was pregnant the entire time. I was sipping the coffee that made me late (meme reference) and actually choked on it. The class tried to backtrack and act like we knew, but it we were too far gone. She literally said, “I can't believe you guys thought I was just fat.” Sis tried to play it off, but when she was grading our final papers she definitely took each of our reactions into account. Moral of the story is: if a professor is making an announcement, put all liquids down.[.C]

Act as if you suspect nothing. You don't have any 'ammunition' to use to do anything other than trying your best to get through the class and into another professor's class who will likely also do the same.

You talk about yourself as a decent person with decent qualities, but likeable is not one of them. Would you find yourself likeable at all? Could you expect people to like you if you imagine scenarios of people not liking you, as you are in effect actively finding reasons to not like yourself? Are you being too hard on yourself by defining likeable as having the approval of people who will genuinely like me, text me, and email me whenever I message them? Is it more assumable to think that keeping to yourself too much is making it hard for people to find things in common with you?

all these false priests and charlatan of eCONomists use their unrealistic assumptions like perfect rationality and self interested actors to maintain the dominance of the rootless capitalist rent seekers by spreading the twisted sick dogma of neoliberalism. there was this one time i read an article on behavioral economics so it's pretty clear to me the whole field is a sham.

First mistake: when you're being involved with the community and other work opportunities it should be because you're personally interested in participating not for a resume boost!!

It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel?

First mistake: when you're being involved with the community and other work opportunities it should be because you're personally interested in participating not for a resume boost!! Second mistake: you're privilege just to have the opportunity to study at a UC when many other people don't. But glad you made the best of your situation and found "happiness" wherever you be at. Go Bears!!!

Why do you want good grades? Grades are just one of the indicators for how well you know the material of a class. It was designed to fit everybody, so in reality it fits no one. It is by far not the only indicator for how good you are in your field. It's up to you how much importance you want to prescribe to it. I was never a great studier or a fast learner, so I had a lower GPA than most of my friends. But for me, school wasn't about grades. School was an opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn, and a degree was just a stepping stone to future jobs. So I didn't stress so much about my grades, paid attention to the classes I liked, and focused the rest of my energy on personal projects. I never even put my GPA on my resume, my projects filled the gap, and I landed decent internships (tho some companies did ask for my GPA. I stopped caring about such closed-minded companies). Point is, there are so many other ways to get a job, like networking or doing research or getting recs. School isn't all about grades, it means whatever you want it to mean. So figure out what you want to get out of it, focus on what you're good at, and don't waste your four years trying to meet other people's standards.

Acquiring true friends takes a lot of work. Most people don't take the time to filter out those who really don't fit their life. So, I would recommend taking a close look at your acquaintences and figure out who you think would add value to your life. Then, carefully but frequently, invite them personally (not an email or text) to get together with you for a meal or a drink. Then, when you're together, focus exclusively on that person. Ask about their interests, their likes and dislikes etc. If they ask about you, answer simply without long explanations. They will react very positively to that experience and you'll be well on your way to creating a very special bond with them. If you see a guy to whom you are attracted, just be very nice to him and he'll soon get the idea that you're interested. Good luck!

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

It is very brave of you to share the bad things happened to you and expressed your emotion entirely. Childhood does have a big influence on your mental health. You are not alone, many people have gone through Cal with depression, like me as a psych major. i was lucky to have friends who know about depression or went through similar problems together. not everyone could understand symptoms of depression and say things to make u feel better, but they do want to help you (except your Dad who might make it worse) try to talk to anyone from psych major, im sure they are, or even i am, happy to talk with you. Make good use of Tang Center, and campus counselling services like Student to Student Peer Counselling, they are on phone or in person. :) Go little Cal Bear, you will be great!

What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!

While you have no reason to listen to this, you don't know me and you seem to be very set in your decision, please don't kill yourself. Depression and anhedonia are terrible, and living with them is horrible but please give it some more time. This is a brain injury, not unlike a concussion or a stroke and it takes time to heal. The brain is incredibly slow at healing itself. It often takes months and several different medications before you find the right one to mitigate the symptoms for you. Please, just don't give up so soon. While memory loss is better than suicide, the possibility of being able to feel happiness is even better than that. Just a little more time OP, for your friends, your family, but most importantly for yourself. You can get through this. Let the people around you support you and if you need more than that, we can change the first sentence I said and you can message me. I'm no one special, just willing to be a friend if you need another.

Whatever you do, don't "just wait" for people to change-they never do! (At least not in the ways you are expecting). Ask yourself what your requirements are for a relationship. Once your standards for quality time, affection, communication, reliability, commitment, etc. are met, it won't matter who is initiating what. A secure relationship allows a person to stop keeping score of everything that happens because you generally feel safe, satisfied, and wanted.

That is unfortunate that your family isn't giving you the support you need. Sexual assaults are the lowest reported crimes because the victim is often ashamed or embarrassed. It is not your fault, people who sexually assault others are the scum of the earth. I was molested when I was a child and still get haunted from it even though it happened almost 10 years ago. It has affected me ever since it happened and will more than likely be that way forever. It isn't something that is easy to forget. My advice for you is to join support groups and talk about it, get your feelings out and try to become comfortable with them. I know talking about it brings up the memories, but it helps. I'd be willing to talk if you ever wanted to. Try to keep your head up.

When I got into Berkeley, I was extremely excited and felt as though I deserved my admission based on my hard work in HS. However, when I actually got to Berkeley, I realized that the majority of my peers are WAAAAY smarter than me....but, who cares?? You got in, stick out your four years, and get UC Berkeley under your belt. I thought the admissions committee was on crack for accepting me after I finished my first semester, but I stuck it out. You obviously have something in you that makes you worthy of being a golden bear. Perseverance is all it takes.. (BTW, I had to look up how to spell "perseverance") :) You got this!

You obviously have something in you that makes you worthy of being a golden bear. Perseverance is all it takes.. (BTW, I had to look up how to spell "perseverance") :) You got this!

This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

[S]
That is a terrible way to grow up! However, it is now your choice as to how you want it to affect your life. You can be a victim forever if you choose. Or, you can get it behind you if you choose. I think you should seek professional assistance and over time, put your past behind you and be the courageous, trusting woman you were meant to be. And, don’t be afraid to talk about your past and don’t be shamed by it. Take a deep breath and take the first step to getting past this.
[S]
It is a shame your self worth is so low. But, it doesnt have to be. Your life and your attitude towards it is self determined. If you have a shitty personality, change it to a pleasant one. Personality is a choice not something that you inherited. A true friend requires work. So, work on it. Talk about them only. Ask them questions. Soon enough, they will take a real interest in you. Dont think suicide ever. You can do this because it isn’t that hard. It is simply a choice to be made. Good luck.

Why do you want good grades? Grades are just one of the indicators for how well you know the material of a class. It was designed to fit everybody, so in reality it fits no one. It is by far not the only indicator for how good you are in your field. It's up to you how much importance you want to prescribe to it. I was never a great studier or a fast learner, so I had a lower GPA than most of my friends. But for me, school wasn't about grades. School was an opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn, and a degree was just a stepping stone to future jobs. So I didn't stress so much about my grades, paid attention to the classes I liked, and focused the rest of my energy on personal projects. I never even put my GPA on my resume, my projects filled the gap, and I landed decent internships (tho some companies did ask for my GPA. I stopped caring about such closed-minded companies). Point is, there are so many other ways to get a job, like networking or doing research or getting recs. School isn't all about grades, it means whatever you want it to mean. So figure out what you want to get out of it, focus on what you're good at, and don't waste your four years trying to meet other people's standards.


[P]
Ya!! Hit me up too:) finding the right spot can be tricky, but you definitely will
[S]
You talk about yourself as a decent person with decent qualities, but likeable is not one of them. Would you find yourself likeable at all? Could you expect people to like you if you imagine scenarios of people not liking you, as you are in effect actively finding reasons to not like yourself? Are you being too hard on yourself by defining likeable as having the approval of people who will genuinely like me, text me, and email me whenever I message them? Is it more assumable to think that keeping to yourself too much is making it hard for people to find things in common with you?
[S]
To those who have hit rock bottom or feel like they're losing their minds or are bearing the weight of each day on their shoulders or are bearing the weight of loneliness in their heavy hearts, others feel it too. You are not alone. Scream until you're listened to. Scream until your pain is heard. It's easier to feel your bones shake and to break down in the office of a psychiatrist than it is to wear the same disguise of everything is okay when nothing is right. And it's fine if other people find out that you aren't okay because one day you will be. Maybe not now. Maybe not tomorrow. But one day you will be. That's how getting better works. It's a process. Go talk to your doctor or your insurance company or walk into urgent care and say you need help. Do what you need to do to get better and that ALWAYS involves getting help from others.

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

I'm sorry this has happened to you write. It is really hard to recover when you've trusted and opened up to therapists only to be let down in the end. I am in a similar situation with my psychologist. Took me ages to trust him, opened up to him about stuff I've never talked about to anyone else, cried myself through very difficult therapy, only for him to throw it all back in my face. He knows I have trust issues especially when it comes to men, because of my past, and he proved me right. I really don't know how you can move on from this, I'm hoping to meet up with an advocate after I've finished treatment to try and find a way forward. Not the same when the trust has gone though is it? I hope you can sort something out xxxx

I would say that it is entirely normal to have 'crushes' it's just just important to be aware that we cannot truly have any more than that as someone looking from a distance. Love can only really come from physical interaction and really knowing a person. Sure, we could obsess over them, but that isn't real because we don't actually know the person; they could be vile in reality, and if we base how we feel about them from the projections they make on social media or in the news, then we only get a filtered version of them, one that is unlikely to reveal any of the bad points about them. So, this would probably fall under 'idealisation' in that you see an ideal person, partly because that is all you're allowed to see and partly because that has become what you want to see. I am guessing that you follow them on social media and the like, so a start would be to break the habit of checking in on them, replacing this behaviour with something else more beneficial. Remind yourself that you don't know that person and that it would be far healthier to focus on 'real world' women and working towards meeting and getting to know someone in that way

Given the times you prefer, and liking empty shops, couldn't you go say half an hour before they shut?

I don't like mornings either, and don't like busy shops, so I go to the supermarket at 2130-2230, and even though a busy supermarket, it empty.

First, I am so sorry that you are going through this. I have dealt with many similar feelings that you are going through right now. In the past I’ve struggled to have a sense of self-worth and self-confidence, and though I have gotten better these feelings still persist to an extent today. Second, I want to assure you that things, though will take time, will get better, even if you may not feel so. Trust me, I’ve felt that way a lot too, where I thought things would not get better. But as long as you try to make things better, even if they are small steps, trust me, they will get better. Lastly, I want to assure you that you are worthy of being here, and no one deserves to feel how you are feeling. Please feel free to message me if you want to talk. Also I encourage you to try out CAPS, but I understand if you don’t find it helpful (I personally didn’t find it that helpful for me as I prefer to talk to friends or at least peers about my problems).

If you prefer someone who takes pride in their appearance there's really nothing wrong with that. A bit harsh, but it's about the line you draw. Yours is at cargo shorts. Other people's may be at simply showering.

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

I really don't know how you can move on from this, I'm hoping to meet up with an advocate after I've finished treatment to try and find a way forward. Not the same when the trust has gone though is it? I hope you can sort something out xxxx

I'm sorry this has happened to you write. It is really hard to recover when you've trusted and opened up to therapists only to be let down in the end. I am in a similar situation with my psychologist.

First, I am so sorry that you are going through this. I have dealt with many similar feelings that you are going through right now. In the past I’ve struggled to have a sense of self-worth and self-confidence, and though I have gotten better these feelings still persist to an extent today. Second, I want to assure you that things, though will take time, will get better, even if you may not feel so. Trust me, I’ve felt that way a lot too, where I thought things would not get better. But as long as you try to make things better, even if they are small steps, trust me, they will get better. Lastly, I want to assure you that you are worthy of being here, and no one deserves to feel how you are feeling. Please feel free to message me if you want to talk. Also I encourage you to try out CAPS, but I understand if you don’t find it helpful (I personally didn’t find it that helpful for me as I prefer to talk to friends or at least peers about my problems).

Hi. As someone with a lot of anxiety, I completely get how crappy it feels to start a new job. Trying to learn the job duties along with gauging the personalities of all the new people you are working with can be overwhelming. Its possible that your participation was listed as optional, because they didn't want to make you feel pressured to attend a birthday lunch for/with people you don't know very well. At least that's what it sounds like to me. My company did a secret santa type thing in my department and gave me the option not to participate, due to only having been in this job for about four months or so (and I normally work night shifts so I don't have a ton of interaction with my coworkers). That's just my two cents on the situation, I hope it helps!

No matter how much you may think your peers have over you, realize that the strangers on the application-evaluation committee (and in the job market) have seen dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of applicants in the past that're better than all of you - and they know from experience that numbers are not people. Sell yourself - in writing and in person. There is more substance to every person than can be notated on an application, and it's your job to show the remaining bits of who you are - and THOSE bits are the ones that will matter most, in the end.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

...The good news: it's even simpler than that. Obviously it'll vary based on the circumstances some, but basically you just have to fill out the readmission application, talk to an adviser, and make a contract about how many classes you can take and when and what grades you need to achieve, etc. ... And then you enroll in your classes like usual (usually through UNEX in what's called concurrent enrollment) and move on. **Disclaimer: I am not an academic adviser... I just have far, far too much personal experience with this. XD**

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

I am so sorry for what you and your family have experienced. I haven't had that type of experience, but I have suffered from PTSD. The more you talk about it, the better. But I would encourage you to speak with a counselor, someone who specializes in trauma. The rest of your life doesn't have to be lived in fear. I believe your story is miraculous. It sounds like God heard you. I believe if you ask Him to help you overcome the trauma, He'll hear you again and answer. I was led to speak to a counselor, and they helped tremendously. Then I continued to attend seminars to learn more about overcoming my past. It's a process, but God is faithful. I've experienced so much healing, and I don't doubt you will as well. Let us know how it goes. We're here with you.

Hey, I've experienced this a lot as well. There are actually a lot of ways to re-ground yourself back. It is hard to do but can be overcome. If you want to,I am down to hang and get food. Shoot me a message? Its pretty scary at first but don't be too alarmed, you are not alone.

This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

I feel okay. Like John Nash, I accept that my hallucinations are not real. They are not real people. So I can let them disappear in the distance. Do you think you could be projecting your feeings about breaking up with the child's mom onto the boy ?? Transferring your feelings onto a 7 month old baby is truly bad for the child. This is your son and he looks up to you. He is the wellspring of love. Let that love infect your being.  Adjusting to the idea that you are a parent for life, that is a big adjustment. No wonder you can't eat or sleep, this was a surprise for you, not a planned event.

I would say that it is entirely normal to have 'crushes' it's just just important to be aware that we cannot truly have any more than that as someone looking from a distance. Love can only really come from physical interaction and really knowing a person. Sure, we could obsess over them, but that isn't real because we don't actually know the person; they could be vile in reality, and if we base how we feel about them from the projections they make on social media or in the news, then we only get a filtered version of them, one that is unlikely to reveal any of the bad points about them. So, this would probably fall under 'idealisation' in that you see an ideal person, partly because that is all you're allowed to see and partly because that has become what you want to see. I am guessing that you follow them on social media and the like, so a start would be to break the habit of checking in on them, replacing this behaviour with something else more beneficial. Remind yourself that you don't know that person and that it would be far healthier to focus on 'real world' women and working towards meeting and getting to know someone in that way

You have been in this position a long time and it will feel shocking to you to be assertive with her. She is being very selfish. Your school work is work enough. When she is verbally abusive to you, you are old enough now to stop pleasing her and tell her instead that you do not deserve to be treated that way. And walk out of the house after you tell her that you do not deserve to be treated that way. Do not do the chores if she verbally abuses you. If you treat me that way, I won't help you at all. You can stand up to her. You are not her little girl anymore. Doing this will feel foreign to you. But she is being very bossy and unkind to a perfect daughter. I tried to get my mother's understanding and approval for years before I realized I wasn't going to get it.

When she is verbally abusive to you, you are old enough now to stop pleasing her and tell her instead that you do not deserve to be treated that way. And walk out of the house after you tell her that you do not deserve to be treated that way. Do not do the chores if she verbally abuses you. If you treat me that way, I won't help you at all. You can stand up to her. You are not her little girl anymore. Doing this will feel foreign to you. But she is being very bossy and unkind to a perfect daughter. I tried to get my mother's understanding and approval for years before I realized I wasn't going to get it.

Do you do anything at all to manage your depression other than hoping group therapy, therapy, and meds will do something for you? If you're too tired to do anything else and you're feeling suicidal, it's time to check yourself into a hospital. I recommend Ronald Reagan if you have the UCLA insurance. Their service is great and the staff is lovely. You deserve to be alive. You deserve to see a smile one day in your reflection and feel it mirrors the joy you will one day have again.

You are a young adult and need your own space, especially with going to med school. You might need to sit down with mom and have a heart to heart talk with her. Explain how difficult med school is and the amount of work required to be successful. She might also need to come to realize that all work and no play is a formula for failure. Remember it is her house and she is doubling as a landlord. It is a difficult situation for both of you.Perhaps you can agree on some things you can do around the house that would be acceptable to both of you. Be firm , loving and prepared when you approach her. Be sure to choose a good time for both of you where you are both relaxed and open to the conversation.

I feel this too. You aren’t alone. Great friends, it’s still not enough. Be careful who you make deeper connections with, because when they stop being your friend, it really hurts. I hope you find what you need

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

My brother killed himself a few years ago. I don't keep track of the date. But losing a child is a whole nother level of heartbreak. I know I was devastated when my GF lost our baby at 3 months. But having actually having had known him and loving him for so many years then losing him cannot be easy. Just try and remember the good times you shared.

To those who have hit rock bottom or feel like they're losing their minds or are bearing the weight of each day on their shoulders or are bearing the weight of loneliness in their heavy hearts, others feel it too. You are not alone. Scream until you're listened to. Scream until your pain is heard. It's easier to feel your bones shake and to break down in the office of a psychiatrist than it is to wear the same disguise of everything is okay when nothing is right. And it's fine if other people find out that you aren't okay because one day you will be. Maybe not now. Maybe not tomorrow. But one day you will be. That's how getting better works. It's a process. Go talk to your doctor or your insurance company or walk into urgent care and say you need help. Do what you need to do to get better and that ALWAYS involves getting help from others.

Hi, you seem to enjoy things like computers and board games. Do you see this as a good thing or a bad thing? I think it is good to spend your free time doing what you enjoy. Even if other people think it's weird. Maybe you can meet people while you play board games at cafes and other public places. If they enjoy it you can talk to them about it. I think people need relationships in order to feel good. Good luck, don't give up.

I'm sorry you've been struggling, I would advise that you go to your GP as soon as possible. If the racing thoughts get too much go to A/E or contact out of hours or 111 if your in the UK. Many mental health conditions have racing thoughts. Are you sleeping? I agree the headache could be from tension/stress. Have you tried any paracetamol did it help? Hope you feel better very soon. Take care

This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

When I had severe headaches, I fixed it by an improved diet, eating less sugar, and drinking more water, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine. A magnesium deficiency can be related to hallucinations and insomnia.

hey, you do you if you're okay with being alone, but remember that not everyone can do that. it would be nice if I didn't get lonely, but I get lonely to the point of severe, impactful depression. that's not something I can just easily be okay with. so think before you say something like that so offhandedly

You talk about yourself as a decent person with decent qualities, but likeable is not one of them. Would you find yourself likeable at all? Could you expect people to like you if you imagine scenarios of people not liking you, as you are in effect actively finding reasons to not like yourself? Are you being too hard on yourself by defining likeable as having the approval of people who will genuinely like me, text me, and email me whenever I message them? Is it more assumable to think that keeping to yourself too much is making it hard for people to find things in common with you?

this is my problem please help me
[S]
So sorry to hear that life had been tough. Let me see if I have your story straight. You feel worthless because of your personality, ie a core part of you that you feel you cannot change. You think that people would not like or want to be friends with you. You probably stick to yourself and not actively try to make friends or you do and you fail. This makes you feel worthless again and continues the loop. Your feels, thoughts, and behavior is conspiring against you. This is a classic example a downward spiral. Please visit CAPS at your next convenience. Once you see your therapist, tell then that you are spiraling. They will help you. Your problem is not small. It is growing but it can be nipped in the bud. You sound motivated to change and really self aware, so I know you can do this!
[S]
having the guy talk to her could just be a temporary fix, so getting help at CAPS or something would be better to get at the root of the problem
[S]
This is unfortunately a very common problem nowadays. I've been there. I felt like my family could't recognize me after long periods of isolation in school. It is scary because it is new, and also alarming. Socialization is necessary for a healthy brain. Make sure to engage on friendships, listen and empathize with your friends.

[S]
It is very brave of you to share the bad things happened to you and expressed your emotion entirely. Childhood does have a big influence on your mental health. You are not alone, many people have gone through Cal with depression, like me as a psych major. i was lucky to have friends who know about depression or went through similar problems together. not everyone could understand symptoms of depression and say things to make u feel better, but they do want to help you (except your Dad who might make it worse) try to talk to anyone from psych major, im sure they are, or even i am, happy to talk with you. Make good use of Tang Center, and campus counselling services like Student to Student Peer Counselling, they are on phone or in person. :) Go little Cal Bear, you will be great!

I miss the deep conversations too. Message me and i would love to do something with you sometime :)

STUFF
[S]
What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to 'just forget about it.'' (what an ignorant idiot they are)). But, I'll tell you one thing: Things don't get better, we get better. This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance. One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles. As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being dramatic or trying to one them up with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you. Last notes: -Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop. -If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust. -It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals. Finally: If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things. You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you. A fine day to you all. As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!
[S]
Felt the same way. Learned to fly solo. Became badass. Then found stuff I valued more than friendship. Like ponies. Then I found real friends.
[S]
I'm sorry this has happened to you write. It is really hard to recover when you've trusted and opened up to therapists only to be let down in the end. I am in a similar situation with my psychologist. Took me ages to trust him, opened up to him about stuff I've never talked about to anyone else, cried myself through very difficult therapy, only for him to throw it all back in my face. He knows I have trust issues especially when it comes to men, because of my past, and he proved me right. I really don't know how you can move on from this, I'm hoping to meet up with an advocate after I've finished treatment to try and find a way forward. Not the same when the trust has gone though is it? I hope you can sort something out xxxx
