Want (new) emotionally close people to hurt me physically: So I thought it was a common thing, but to my surprise Google did not think like that. Whenever I am getting emotionally close with someone, either a crush or just a friend with whom we talk a lot one-on-one, I want them to hurt me physically. It happens with pretty much every new close person and this pattern itself has been present since childhood. It sounds a bit crazy written like that, but I do believe it is actually quite usual. I have not figured out the mechanism. It might be partly to punish myself for getting close with someone. It might be partly to "test" people, to see, how far I can make them go. And to avoid disappointment and trusting them. It is partly just to "get it over with", like a compulsion. Does anyone else have this or does it ring a bell? I have a background of ~15 years of on-and-off self-injury every other year or so. I do not think I have BPD or anything like that, maybe slight PTSD. It's not a sexual thing. And I am highly functional, manage my work and uni etc very well. Ideas about the mechanism?

Your "fast" episode sounds a lot like classic mania. Everything is driven, sped up, bouncing wildly from one thing to another. Brilliant ideas that you realize later didn't even make sense. Not sleeping. With my Bipolar II diagnosis I don't experience mania quite to the extreme that you're describing - no psychosis etc., only on the lows - and it's called "hypomania." But even with that, I'm all too familiar with that sickening crash. It seems like at a certain point in a manic episode, your mind and body just plain run out of energy. No one can sustain that accelerated pace forever. For me actually it has never lasted longer than two weeks. And then you find yourself teetering on the edge. The smallest thing can trigger it, and before you know it, so rapidly that someone watching you could probably see it happen - you fall out of the sky. I have just recently pulled out of a very long and deep depressive episode that was triggered by my diagnosis and exacerbated by the mood stabilizer they put me on. The dosage, as it turns out, was too high; not only was it knocking off the highs, but it was flattening my mood at a level far below where it should have been. A simple change in dose of the same mood stabilizer, plus a different antidepressant, and I truly feel like a new person. Sadly, like your team told you, it just does take time. Different people respond in different ways to various medications and therapies, and it takes time just to see if a medication is working before trying something else. Most antidepressants, for example, won't take effect until about a month after starting them. In dealing with the fallout from your manic episode, knowledge is power. You can't change what you did, but you can learn and understand why you did it - why your mind was out of control. Strained and broken relationships are the most painful thing, and sometimes they never can be repaired. But as I'm learning, it's so important that you forgive yourself and move on from there. To keep wallowing in mortified guilt isn't going to get you anywhere. It just makes your offense look bigger and bigger in hindsight. Anyway I'm wishing you the best in all this. It's a tough road for sure, and things may get worse before they get better (I hope not!) but they will get better.

I would say that it is entirely normal to have 'crushes' it's just just important to be aware that we cannot truly have any more than that as someone looking from a distance. Love can only really come from physical interaction and really knowing a person. Sure, we could obsess over them, but that isn't real because we don't actually know the person; they could be vile in reality, and if we base how we feel about them from the projections they make on social media or in the news, then we only get a filtered version of them, one that is unlikely to reveal any of the bad points about them. So, this would probably fall under 'idealisation' in that you see an ideal person, partly because that is all you're allowed to see and partly because that has become what you want to see. I am guessing that you follow them on social media and the like, so a start would be to break the habit of checking in on them, replacing this behaviour with something else more beneficial. Remind yourself that you don't know that person and that it would be far healthier to focus on 'real world' women and working towards meeting and getting to know someone in that way

the thing with neighbor problems especially if there are lots of other neighbors close by, they really cant be sure. i mean the folk opposite could have complained. i have been in a situation where i complained about a neighbour who was a hazard to themselves and others. and the person did actually say to me it was you wasnt it and i denied it. as i had nothing to loose and they would never be sure. like you i couldnt cope with the situation and needed to bring it to an end as no one else who lived in the neighborhood was going to do it. and really they need to be careful as if they are doing drugs they need to keep a fairly low profile and any possibilty of keeping their little boy is at stake. so the odds are stacked against them. maybe might be a good idea to report them for drug use to the police while you are about it. as then the police can keep an eye on it. and maybe take action in the future again you can remain anonymous

I’m not sure if this is the right section but I think it’s time for me to start talking about one incident that kept happening to me in school that I keep trying to repress for close to twenty years now. I’m giving a spoiler warning as my story involves sexual assault. I think what is occurring in Hollywood right now is triggering memories I keep trying to forget. Basically the story is when I was in ninth grade,which was from 2000-2001, I was walking down the hall from the locker room to the gym when I felt someone touching me inappropriately from behind and laughing about it. I was horrified and ran off terrified and the female gym teacher saw me run away frightened and went after me. I know who did it because the kid panicked when I ran and screamed “Oh no!” I was too afraid to talk about what he did to me and wouldn’t tell the teacher what had occurred. The gym teachers eventually found out through the others I guess but the kid who did this to me didn’t seem to be punished enough for what he did. I was too traumatized by it that I didn’t even tell my family that I was sexually assaulted. Then the same thing kept happening to me every day I had gym in the locker room for months and whoever kept doing it to me always ran off quickly enough that I never saw who it was but I’m 95% sure it was the same one who did it the first time since he kept bullying me in other ways until graduation. I became so afraid of gym that I would change quickly without ever turning my back and making sure I was the first to get changed and in the gym and first to change and leave the locker room. That is when the school called the crazy lady (the one who abused after she started drinking). She confronted me and then tried to get me to talk but I still refused to annd she then said to me, “That proves you aren’t gay!” as if I was supposed to enjoy being violated the way I was. The last three months of that school year I had to switch to the adaptive gym class for handicapped kids because I was too afraid to go to regular gym.My fear is that he is a sex offender now that is still hurting people and getting away with it because the victims he hurt are also too afraid to talk about it. I’ve felt this way for years but I know that I can’t press charges against him because it was so long ago. Part of me wants to shout out his name as a sexual predator but part of me knows I can’t because of privacy laws and I have no real proof other than the horrible memory of what he did to me. Plus his family has quite a bit of money and I don’t so he’d probably win the case anyway. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m pretty sure if it weren’t for my meds and my dislike of the taste of alcohol, I’d be drinking heavily just to repress the memory of my sexual assault. It was that traumatic for me.

I’m sorry you are feeling like you are worthless and I know – I’ve been there. The reality is you are worth so very much and I hope you can begin to see this. You are uniquely gifted and you have a story to tell and a part to play in your own life and in others’. Many people in your position are not sensitive to how their problems affect others. You care about your husband’s reactions to your situation and that is a hopeful sign – you have not withdrawn into yourself. You are aware of how you feel; ask yourself how this is impacting your behavior, and also what you are doing to change your situation. You need action here. Have you talked to your family doctor? You have a psychiatrist – do you consider them an effective help? If not, try someone else but keep persevering. Have you tried simply a counselor? If you’re on medication, do you stay on track with it? These are all positive things you can do to help yourself. Once you feel you’re moving forward, talk this over with your husband. He loves you and I’m sure is concerned and would be encouraged.
[S]
I’m so sorry for what you’re experiencing right now. I want to encourage you to seek help and support from your family and friends or consider to join a support group where you can meet face to face. It will help you not to feel isolated and alone. Consult with your doctor regularly, if you think your medications are not working, you can ask for a new prescription. Take good care of yourself, eat healthy diet, have enough sleep and regular exercise. Please don’t try to harm yourself. Don’t give up, you will get better. I will be praying for you.
[S]
I’d also look into why exactly this is causing you stress... being asked to sit with workmates, teambuilding lunches, it doesn’t sound like it should be causing stress. Similarly it’s kind of normal to be open to a certain extent when with others. So if this is causing you stress, perhaps there is some other underlying cause? What Poopy Doll said about the forces is also probably right, that the kind of attitudes towards “building character” there are even more old school then at other institutions. It’s worth thinking about what you are letting yourself in for...

I need friends, but I don't know how to go about making any. I'm 42, diagnosed with bipolar 2, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and PTSD. I feel so depressed right now. I work full time, but am still living pay check to pay check, and I am exhausted, both physically and emotionally. I need a life outside of work, but I fear I have nothing to give in a friendship, let alone more than one friendship.

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

Here a couple of things I'd say to offer some support (although I am by no means a licensed professional): 1. Structure - You noted to us that whenever you're alone, your anxiety and depression get the best of you. I'm the same way (minus the depression), because my OCD makes me obsess a lot over little things. In general, I would recommend structure. Get out more often, find things to fill your time with—that are healthy—and do your best to lead a productive life. 2. Finding a Job - Finding a job sounds like it will be essential to your recovery path. What I would recommend is asking your clinical supports (e.g counselor) if there are any rehab programs that help mentally ill people find employment. In my state of Massachusetts, we have an organization called MRC that does just that. My hope is that those options will be made available to you. However, I would also say to take it easy. While money is a present problem for you, putting too much pressure on yourself over finding a job while you're already on a bumpy road will exacerbate your symptoms. You want to ensure you're stable going into a job. 3. Coping Skills - Coping skills are also imperative to your overall mental health. Everyone needs them. When you have moments of self-doubt, ask yourself some questions: "What makes this not my fault?" "What can I do to help myself?" Something else that will help is giving yourself self-soothing. Coloring, writing, drawing, listening to music, meditation, and exercise are all healthy examples of coping mechanisms that are recommended by clinical professionals. They keep us feeling strong and help us keep our minds in the right place. 4. Give Yourself a Break - You're not to blame for everything. It really is unfortunate that you've lost so many people, and I'm very sorry that all of these difficulties are piling up on your shoulders, but there is a lot of hope still in store for you. You have to be easy on yourself, and recognize that we're only human. Pace your recovery and make sure your counselor is aware of how you feel. If you need any further encouragement or support, let me know!

Hi everyone, this is my first time posting on a forum but I don’t know anyone who really understands how am feeling so am hoping to find someone who does. I am 30 years old and for aslong as I can remember I have felt this underlying sadness but lately I feel like I am unable to hide it. I am not sure where it stems from and I think that’s the issue because I don’t exactly know how to take the steps to fix something when am not sure of the cause. I have terrible negative thoughts about people close to me dying, I feel like there is something missing inside of me to make me happy. I have members of my family who are struggling with depression and I don’t know how to handle it, I know it’s not about me because they are the ones who are depressed, but it’s like I love them so much I can’t deal with the sadness of them being sad so I completely shut down and this can make me seem heartless but I just don’t know how to react so I become numb. I am always the person who offers the best advice and people think I am really strong so for me to come out and say I have been feeling this way it would be such a big shock and I don’t like being the centre of attention so I keep it all in. It’s now affecting my relationship with my partner, as me feeling numb and not being able to communicate my feelings comes across as me being heartless and he isn’t going to stick around for much longer. Somewhere along the line I have learn that showing. your emotions makes you vunerable and I don’t want to be seen in that way. Does anyone else experience anything like this? Everything seems like a big effort I know am not depressed, well I don’t think I am, but something isn’t right. I hope someone can relate to me in some way.

My view on this is that everyone goes through life doing the best that they can, given the background that circumstances and their parents gave them. Perhaps that psychiatrist was abused as a child, you don’t know. But I feel that people inherently do what they can to make a good life for themselves and their loved ones. So when we come across people who hurt us, it’s often that they are carrying out patterns that they have inherited from their parents, teachers and so on. The whole process of rectifying these things, of introducing greater compassion and removing old inherited harm, is something that psychologists have been working at for ages. The process of working through our own trauma is something that takes time. Finding ways to love ourselves, forgive ourselves for things we did which in hindsight were maybe not right, accept ourselves in the present moment and in the past, these things are all difficult but very worthwhile. It’s good to spend time and effort on introspection, on why things are the way they are, and finding some love for that boy with Tourette’s.
[S]
I’d also look into why exactly this is causing you stress... being asked to sit with workmates, teambuilding lunches, it doesn’t sound like it should be causing stress.

I just don't care. About anything. I cannot help but not care, at all. I believe I am a narcissist. I have come to the point of not wanting to do anything besides sleeping and eating and staying warm this winter. Whenever I try to force myself to do other things, I start feeling incredibly tired and careless. That, and my focus and memory are gone. My mind goes into complete chaos and aggravation. I am constantly depressed. My mood stabilizing pills and anti-depressants don't really do much I think. I am simply a parasite off of my parents. And I don't really care about them either. I have no emotions. Like I said, I'm a narcissist. I still have a fear of death, of dying and being judged by the Christian God. And also a natural fear of death and bleeding in particular. Yet, I feel that I might still be able to commit suicide. However, right now my conditions are not that bad I feel, so there's that that's preventing me. I also know that killing myself would make my parents and relatives sad, so I think I won't do it anytime soon while they are still alive, hopefully. But when there's no one to support me, that's a different kettle of fish. Is there any advice people can give this narcissist, or is there anyone in similar shoes?
[S]
I've been there many times. The feeling of numbness and guilt are overwhelming. Trust me, we are all narcissistic and it is ok to be so a little bit. I suggest exploring your emotions a bit and not hiding or being afraid of them. I'm glad you are afraid of dying since that is a clear sign that part of your mind still is convincing you to not commit suicide. It seems like you care for your parents but you don't realize the complexity of the emotion. You don't want them to be sad and it is kind of clear that you don't want to bother them. Take some time to reflect and see yourself without labels such as good, bad, parasite, etc. Parents are suppose to be a support and as long as they are willing to do so, let them do it. This inquietude that you feel is a clear sign that you are still tuning your ambitions. Keep looking for things that you love to do.
[S]
You don't sound like a narcissist to me. You just sound extremely depressed. Usually we think of depression as a feeling of sadness - but it isn't necessarily. When I am very depressed, I simply become numb and emotionless except for a cold, analytical self-hatred. Hold onto the reasons that you have for not committing suicide. Remember that it is a very final solution, and mental illness can be treated though it is often a long, rocky road. Have you ever seen a psychiatrist? You may have to try different medications for your depression (and bipolar?) Not every medication works for everyone, and you have to find the combination that's right for you. I feel that would be the first step, and from there you may be able to see a therapist and work your way through this. Don't give up, you are a worthwhile person!
[S]
1) It's absolutely perfectly ok and normal to not be sure at times or even most or all the time. 2) Yes it's normal to be honest and say you are not sure but also it's best to say you are not sure if you really are not sure. Imagine this situation: An athlete call Bob hasn't had much training and has been eating junk food, and his trainer asks if he wants to participate in an up coming race. Bob now has two choices, be honest with his trainer or lie and say he is ready. So what you did it's correct. It's always best to be honest. 3) Yea i would say it;s normal to disagree with your family/siblings/parents about principals, philosophies, in regards to life. I'm different to both my parents in my life view and principals. Some people are similar to their parents, but others are not. 4) Just know that you have not done anything wrong and that you should be proud that you have a great quality in being honest. You know yourself best. And hopefully then you can put this behind you. And also know that you can always ask on this forum for an opinion or to vent about life. We are not judgemental here and we will always support one another.


[P]
Racing thoughts: Does anyone else suffer with this? I get it really bad at night and it keeps me awake and goes through to the day sometimes. It's just one of my symptoms but I haven't been diagnosed with anything in particular yet. I go through what I've done though the day, what I didn't do, conversations I've had wih people, what should I do tomorrow or now. Maybe I should change clothes, 3 or 4 times just to put pj's on again. It's never ending. The way I explain it to my pdoc is its like trying to watch 3 TVs at once. I had it really bad yesterday and rang my support worker and all I could say was "I don't know how I feel, it's just like, I feel like, like, like" I got annoyed with myself in the end and told her "I just like, can't even think" I couldn't even make real sentences. It was scary but I feel better today after a good night sleep. I was told a few months ago I was having a psychotic episode and that's it really. But isn't psychosis just a symptom of something else?
[S]
I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one

It doesn't look like it effects dopamine, but I only looked quickly, the TD thread was about antipsychotics which antagonise (restrict) dopamine. Escitalopram looks to be a SSRI which means it mainly works on serotonin (by increasing it). Wikipedia says "SSRI can rarely cause extrapyramidal side effects including akathisia through the indirect inhibition of dopamine" but whether TD is recorded I don't know. Stick to your guns, it's criminal how every time someone diagnosed with a mental health diagnosis has complex health issues due to the meds they describe they fob us off and put it down to mental health to cover their arses. To try and stick us back on the same substance which caused us such harm is sickening. I'm fighting that fight myself and know how it feels, but if we don't fight for ourselves and each other who will. I think the one thing we should all try and do is make it easier for those who face the same problems after us. For me it makes my experiences mean something if others can benefit. The main way I can think of is by reporting side effects of meds online and to the relevant bodies. In the UK that body is https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ and I encourage anyone with bad side effects to report them if they feel they have the strength to do it, because not enough Doctors are doing this which reinforces their head in the sand approach by making side effects look rarer and less significant in the stats. You can report side effects to rxisk.org too and print off a report to take to your Doctor if you like. If your Doctors wont listen advocate for yourself and insist on finding ones that will. If you're not up to doing that find an advocate and ask them to do it for you.

does anyone know what’s wrong with me? for as long as i can remember, i have not been able to feel sympathy/empathy. i pretend to care when others are upset because i feel like i should, but for some reason when others cry or are upset i think the issue is petty and unimportant. to sum it up, i just get annoyed. on top of that, i feel empty. all of the ‘emotions’ i show on the surface are faked. i’m never happy, and i’m never necessarily sad. i’m just emotionless, and the only emotion i can actually feel is anger. i get angry extremely easy, and i find myself snapping at others a lot. my friends always tell me i’m so nice and sweet, but i’m really not. it’s all faked. everything about my personality is fake because i don’t feel anything. i sometimes feel remorse, but only if i get in trouble for something i’ve done. lastly, i tend to only be motivated to do the things that will benefit me. as selfish as it sounds, i can’t help it. i have no idea what’s wrong, but i know it’s not okay. if you have an idea of what i’m talking about, please reply because i could really use some advice.

I got diagnosed with depression first.. At around 20.. i was well suicidal and did allot of hard core self harm... I've been on meds ever since.. 27 years of junk... They changed my diagnosis all the time when i was younger.. They almost put me on lithium at one point.. Then they thought i was schizophrenic for a while..

I suffered from terrible head shaking and blinking as a child when going through relentless physical and mental abuse off parents, family members and other kids my age, it got to the point i couldn't concentrate on anything because of it and the abuse i got off people got even worse because of it. I thought it was me with the problem and blamed myself for years. When i started reading psychology books in my late teens and into my 20s then i woke up to the problem not being me, it was all the bastards giving me shit all my life. I took control of my life and read up on all kinds of subjects then became confident to the pint of arrogance and i showed noting but contempt to all and anyone who tried to put me down. My ticks stopped and for the last 20 years i only ever get them if i am stressed. i find they stop when i try not to focus on them, forget you have ticks and they seem to go away, or at least thats what i have found over the years.

Fell out with my mother over depression. Hi all, I have suffered with depression and anxiety on and off for a few years now but this past year has been the worst for me. I am on sertraline 50mg and propronalol 140mg. I had a really upsetting episode the other morning and ended up on the phone to the crisis team. I won’t go into all the details but the first person I wanted to speak to was my mam. She ended up telling me she was done with me, I have a perfect life. People have children murdered or raped, and if I had real depression I wouldn’t be able to go out for my partners birhday, and I would of killed myself by now. She then went on to say she felt like she had lost a child with me, I don’t have a relationship with my brothers and sisters, and my boyfriend doesn’t understand me even when he says he does. I am silly for feeling this way because I don’t have a real reason. She was brought up with a paedophile dad and she is skint and can’t afford my siblings Christmas presents so if anyone should be in a dark hole it should be her. She said depressed people don’t air their problems on social media (even though I feel this helps me as I want more people to understand) she said people won’t understand as they aren’t my friends. My mam really upset me she said she’s done with me now and asif I don’t already feel guilty enough for feeling this way she’s now made me feel stupid and pathetic and unworthy. I’ve had to take 3 weeks off work just to sort my Head out. I can’t explain what goes on in my head so how Can I make her understand. She has really upset me and made my illness worse and it’s my 21st birthday on Wednesday and I doubt we will be even made up for that.

I’m so sorry for what you’re experiencing right now. I want to encourage you to seek help and support from your family and friends or consider to join a support group where you can meet face to face. It will help you not to feel isolated and alone. Consult with your doctor regularly, if you think your medications are not working, you can ask for a new prescription. Take good care of yourself, eat healthy diet, have enough sleep and regular exercise. Please don’t try to harm yourself. Don’t give up, you will get better. I will be praying for you.

I’d also look into why exactly this is causing you stress... being asked to sit with workmates, teambuilding lunches, it doesn’t sound like it should be causing stress. Similarly it’s kind of normal to be open to a certain extent when with others. So if this is causing you stress, perhaps there is some other underlying cause? What Poopy Doll said about the forces is also probably right, that the kind of attitudes towards “building character” there are even more old school then at other institutions. It’s worth thinking about what you are letting yourself in for...

I usually just make sporadic eye contact - look, hold for a few seconds, look away - there’s no point in getting into staring contests. Sometimes for emphasis I’ll hold eye contact a bit longer, but I find it uncomfortable as well. I think most people do, and so it’s perfectly fine not to make eye contact in most cases. I do make eye contact with girls I find attractive. Can’t help it, I just like looking into their eyes.

I just feel so hopeless: I am in a very bad spot in my life right now. I have battled with depression on and off, but I am currently in a downward spiral of despair. I lost my mom less than two weeks ago. She wasn’t doing well, was in the hospital and she just stopped breathing, everything. They tried to bring her back but nothing could be done. I lost my dad to cancer 2 years ago. I’m 38 y.o., childless. I’m married, but I just don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to hurt my husband, but I just am very very depressed. I know I have to get professional help but it just seems like nothing ever is going to help. I hate my job, don’t have anything to live for. I guess I don’t even know why I’m writing this because I don’t think anything can help. I see nothing ahead for me. I am so lost, I feel like nothing is worth living for.

My view on this is that everyone goes through life doing the best that they can, given the background that circumstances and their parents gave them. Perhaps that psychiatrist was abused as a child, you don’t know. But I feel that people inherently do what they can to make a good life for themselves and their loved ones. So when we come across people who hurt us, it’s often that they are carrying out patterns that they have inherited from their parents, teachers and so on. The whole process of rectifying these things, of introducing greater compassion and removing old inherited harm, is something that psychologists have been working at for ages. The process of working through our own trauma is something that takes time. Finding ways to love ourselves, forgive ourselves for things we did which in hindsight were maybe not right, accept ourselves in the present moment and in the past, these things are all difficult but very worthwhile. It’s good to spend time and effort on introspection, on why things are the way they are, and finding some love for that boy with Tourette’s.

I’m alone too - a widow - and find travelling and socialising especially hard. I am learning to cope and can now travel around by train and across London without any help. I do still get nervous but have decided to keep going anyway as I can have panic attacks just in the house when I am not under any pressure. The trick in my case has been to write down every single aspect of the journey before hand. Time I need to leave the house, time of bus, time of train, carriage and seat number. VERY precise directions about each stage of the journey - get off train, turn left to ticket barrier, turn left to station exit etc. And I tick off each stage when it is managed. It is more a case of managing the fear rather than overcoming it. And it can go wrong. On my last trip the train station was having some reconstruction work done and I ended up at an exit I didn’t recognise - in the dark!!!! Happened over a week ago and I am only just recovering. The other thing that helps, if you have a mobile phone, have some support back up from an understanding friend or relative who can talk you through the situation if things do come totally unstuck.

Advice desperately needed: I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't know if anyone will care. I don't know if I'm just being weak and pathetic here. If you've got a few minutes, please read.. I don't even know what I'm going to write yet but I really need someone to hear it. I broke up with my boyfriend about two weeks ago. I was with him for two years. Those years were filled with an imbalance of emotional distress. I tried, for a large part of it, to ignore my own emotions entirley and give all to help him. After about a year I guess this self suppression became too much and it all started to bubble over, like a stove kettle heated and forgotten. He was a lot older than me. He never ever was physically abusive, unless you can count preventing me from leaving in times of great distress (which I won't, as so many people suffer so greatly). I don't know if he really loved me. But he blamed me for not being able to help him enough. He blamed me for him not having a job. He blamed me for his lying and consequent stealing ( it broke my heart and dreamsof the future when I found out he was lying about ever having a job, actually getting up each morning to pretend to go, and was at the same time stealing hundreds from my house, my room and my mother.) And I STILL took him back, he spoke sweetly and I was trapped again. He told me this was special, no one had anything like this, and oh, if I ever left he would kill himself. " answer the phone now, or I die.' If you ever do drugs again not only will I die but that will be it I will never forgive you you f****** druggy' *two weeks later*: oh I got some stuff for us, we're doing it!!!' He didn't want me to see friends without him present and I was scared to do so as he always caused a huge scene and they wouldn't want to see me anymore. I wasn't allowed male friends really, which is ok I guess I understand. I work alot and help around the house alot due to it being very needed at home, and although he didn't work and I saw him everyday he was always saying how I didn't give him enough time. he used to harm himself and when with an old group of his friends LOVED really really humilating me from time to time, getting them all to hate me and then not telling me they did and getting upset when I didn't want to go there. And when I didit was always drugs drugs drugs and an atmosphere of hostility. I was so scared to leave for a long time it was easier to stay. The stealing kind of ended it for me butI thought the problem was me not listening or caring enough and that I just needed to be better somehow. The constant atguements and doubt werepiling on topof years of emotional pain, trauma and dirstress and maybe it was all my fault or just partly but.. I'm going on here I know this is boring. No one will read this much for me, but I'llkeep typing anyway. So I broke up with him after a horrible argument in which he said " well do you know why I've always lied to you about so much?? It's YOU. You don't care and you don't listen ! I don't have a job because of YOU you won't help me ! My friend X had his girfriend take his CVS out everywhere why can't you be more like her???" I said get out. Its over. I was crying and shaking asking for a break saying I'm sorry I just need to build myself up again please give me some time and he said no. We aren't having a break. I locked him out and said im sorry it's over please go. It was 11 pm or later and he was shouting and crying knowing my family was sleeping, he could see me in great distress through the window and kept tapping it over and over and over and over and over and over an over and over and over and over. I was in such a state when he finally left. Then came the sweet messages. For once I didn't give in. This hurt so bad because I did love him but slowly dawned upon me a sense of freedom and I realised I could be a teenager again. That weekend, about a week after, I went out and did pills. With my friend at her flat. A guy lives in the same building, lets call him J. I was drugged up and happy and untouchable and I kissed and hugged him. My friend had to leave for some reason or another so after a heavy night I stayed in Js room.I mustof looked like such a freak, in his bed with a thick hoody on terrified he would see my abudence of scars and realise I am not fun and happy and nice and sociable and funny or pretty. I had sex with him thatnext morning. It was so stupid. I didn't think I was that type of girl. I regret it alot. But J and I carried on speaking over text and he kept saying he really likes me blah blah trying to get me to come and see him and texting me all the time. Ex found out and I denied it which was probably wrong but he was going to over there and kill the guy. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm going there on Friday for a party. I'm going to be staying with J. Schizoprenia runs in my genes unfortunately, I grew up around a close family member suffering eith it. They all day marijuana switched something in his head. He died three years ago I miss him a lot. I insult him as I have smoked alot of weed. I have done many drugs. I don't smoke as much anymore. Well last night Iwent for a smoke with a mate in another mates car the music was loud and all seemed good I got really high and the twisted stories ( I hesitate to call it paranoia due to the pains of people I have met ) . I thought J was only seeing me so he could film me having sex with him and use it to blackmail me. Thatour mutual friend was in on it and maybeshe and J are sleeping together and she wants revenge for something I have forgotten or never realised.I thought Ex was in on it all too. That I am a huge joke and everyone isin on something. Everyone knows something I dont. I never am smoking weed again, I was so quiet and scared I bet the people I wss with thought I was a freak and i haven't told J maybe some part of me realises it's all stupid and unlikely . I can't eat, I had a some problems with food when I was about 11 of 12. Also self harm, alot of it. I was homless and lived with a family member who wss having a mental breakdown at this age. i witnessed someone self harming badly.. I never lived in a housefor more than 2 years before this, I had no long term friends. We went into care. Didn't stay long. Came out and family member was a lot better and amazing I must say she is amazing. I am not meant to talk about this irs the past i need to get over it right. So a little or i guess long while later when I met Ex I thought he wwas my saviour I was so mentally screwed. I feel like the pains of our relationship have just gone into the same jar and now it's cracking. I can't eat and I'm already skinny enough in myopinion I want to put on weight and I'm just losing it. I work looking after the elderly and I love it but everything feels fake. I just cry all of the time. There is this horrible anxiouspulsating fuzzy weight in my chest and I can't sit still I can't focus on anything I can't do anything I can't sleep until early hours and then I sleep for ages and I'm still tired and I know I suck. This is all pathetic. No one will read this. I have antidepressants prescribed but I'm so scaredd of feeling worse for a month that I haven't taken them and my own personal goal is to tackle this without them but I guess I personally can't do this. I get suicidal thoughts alot but I simply can't leave my family they love and depend on me to some extent I guess I have quite a lot of responsibility in comparison to some of peers as far as I can observe but I'm so scared I'm going to the friwnds and Js on Friday to do pills with all of these other people and when I'm on it I'll shine and be confident and amazing and lovely and I can pretend to be all of these things sometimes like at work but I feel it's all fake im nothing but a parisite at my core. I'm so sad and scared . I'm sorry for wasting your time if anyone did read this it's all pretty pathetic huh? What a waste of time

You don't trust him. That's not a good early sign for sure. Here's my two cents: Coming from someone who's been married and separated in that marriage, the best advice I've ever gotten is to never make any major decision regarding your relationship really fast or out of an emotional place. If you were already married, I'd say take sixmonths to a year before deciding to leave or stay. You are engaged, still a major commitment but with less weight. Maybe we'll say 3 months. Why? Because we tend to make the wisest decisions when we have time to think and let our emotions settle. You love him but don't trust him. You will need time to communicate and work on that in order to decide whether a marriage will work or not. If you need to postpone the wedding, by all means, postpone it. That may be a good time to tie in the conversation you'll have with him about trust. Avoid accusing him and use I statements." I'm struggling to trust you here. I'm reevaluating our relationship but I'd like to make it work,." Etc Whatever you do, do not just freak out and leave and call it off in one day. Do not make a decision out of hurt and being upset because you won't be truly ready to move on. It is good to stay with the one you love--- if after a time of careful consideration, you are confident you can be a team and face struggles together. Also, sex does not keep a marriage. If he loves you, he will be faithful. If he's unfaithful and loving it, no amount of sex can make him true to you. That being said, consider if there's something he's not getting from you that can be easily adjusted. Something like the level of respect you treat him with. A lot of men thrive off our respect in a relationship. Ive said a lot. Hope things work out.

My ex-boyfriend has Asperger's. He is highly intelligent, focused and methodical, with an odd, very dry sense of humour. He's quiet and awkward around people and often talked about not being able to show emotion like he thought was proper. Like me, social situations make him anxious. He has often been depressed and irritable but I don't recall any sudden mood swings.
[S]
This is so horrible. Haven't you ever thought, Louise, that maybe you don't have "factitious disorder?" If I recall correctly you said the diagnosis was made by a doctor who soon after lost his job. He was yelling at you, which completely discredits any so-called health care worker. I don't know you of course. But you do NOT strike me as someone who's just making up stories to get attention. You have had huge upheaval and tragedy in your life, and are struggling. You were raped - you remember it and know who did it - and you did the right thing to report him to the police. You bear no responsibility whatsoever for his actions. It's not your fault you were raped, and it's not your fault he killed himself. I agree that everyone, even those who are "attention seekers," should be treated with compassion and respect. But I urge you not to paste that label on yourself because of one ignorant doctor. You are not evil.

Neighbors harassing me: Hi guys my neighbors have been harassing me by shining lasers at my window, they use it with a drone. I can hear the drone flying near my window and can see the laser shining at my window though haven't been able to catch it with a camera. I have had to got to hospital to be medicated for a week because it got too much. They keep me up throughout the night and when I get up I can hear them laughing like they are happy harassing me! I have told friends and my mother and they think I'm going mad. Can anyone help me at all???
[S]
You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.
[S]
Shame your cctv doesn't work, I have motion sensors on mine, so they aren't recording all the time. No point them recording nothing! Keep a camera handy, and record dates and times. Problem is of course, from a flying drone you can't prove who's flying it for police purposes. But gettting evidence is a start. This will become a big problem in future, let me tell you.
[S]
This may not be a wise move from a legal standpoint, but I would knock it out of the air. You'd surely know who was flying it when they came to collect the wreckage. But then that might instigate a fight. I HATE drones. I read about a guy who shot one down with a shotgun because the neighbor was using it to take pictures of his young daughters in bathing suits near their pool. My brother told me about a nature show he was watching, they had a drone getting close up photos of a chimpanzee or other ape. The ape getting pissed off at it casually picked up a stick and knocked it out of the air smashing it to pieces. I feel the same way about drones as the ape did.

Shell-shocked: I don't really know where to start, but I'm here because I wanted to find somewhere where others have relatable experiences. I hope it's okay to post in this section; I have done because it doesn't necessarily fit a specific single illness, and is more my experience of the last several months. I have a long history of on-off depression which has gone untreated for years. In spring, I started feeling 'fast'. That's the best way I can describe it. Everything had been going great, I was working well, achieving a lot, and then everything went fast. To start with that was okay; I've never been a great sleeper so I didn't think it was a big deal when I stopped sleeping and I was filling every hour with productive things (work, home improvements, exercise, future plans, you name it). But things got faster and faster and I got more and more impulsive. Sometimes I didn't care, and it felt great but at other times I knew something wasn't right and I felt torn apart because I was out of control. I was referred to my local MH services for mood disorders but there was a long wait to be seen. By July, everything escalated and I experienced my first episode of psychosis. This lasted on and off for a month or so, and no medication they gave me touched me at all - I couldn't sleep, I couldn't stop. I'll not go into details but eventually I crashed down from this, and ever since have been spiraling into the worst depression I have ever experienced. I'm so lost. I'm shellshocked by what has happened to my life. I'm mortified by what I've put my partner (lives away) and a few close friends through. I'm exhausted. I keep doing the things you're supposed to do - I get up in the morning, I take exercise, I've moved back to my parents because I needed other people around me to provide some structure (some expectation to get up and function). It doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm supposed to return to work this month. I don't know how I can do that. I'm going through the motions and it just gets harder and harder to keep awful thoughts at bay. I'm under the early intervention team. They are treating me cautiously for bipolar I think, but won't make a diagnosis because they 'don't want to label' me. I don't expect a miracle from them, but nothing they have done or said helps at all. They just tell me it takes time, but I don't feel I have time. I know nobody here can fix this for me. I don't expect that. But I just wondered if any of you have any ideas how to pick yourself up and move forwards from a major MH episode that's left you feeling like I do now? And I guess I want to know I'm not the only one who feels like this. I think I feel like I've lost control and I need to regain that some how, but nothing I do seems to help. Thanks to anybody who reads this.

Your "fast" episode sounds a lot like classic mania. Everything is driven, sped up, bouncing wildly from one thing to another. Brilliant ideas that you realize later didn't even make sense. Not sleeping. With my Bipolar II diagnosis I don't experience mania quite to the extreme that you're describing - no psychosis etc., only on the lows - and it's called "hypomania." But even with that, I'm all too familiar with that sickening crash. It seems like at a certain point in a manic episode, your mind and body just plain run out of energy. No one can sustain that accelerated pace forever. For me actually it has never lasted longer than two weeks. And then you find yourself teetering on the edge. The smallest thing can trigger it, and before you know it, so rapidly that someone watching you could probably see it happen - you fall out of the sky. I have just recently pulled out of a very long and deep depressive episode that was triggered by my diagnosis and exacerbated by the mood stabilizer they put me on. The dosage, as it turns out, was too high; not only was it knocking off the highs, but it was flattening my mood at a level far below where it should have been. A simple change in dose of the same mood stabilizer, plus a different antidepressant, and I truly feel like a new person. Sadly, like your team told you, it just does take time. Different people respond in different ways to various medications and therapies, and it takes time just to see if a medication is working before trying something else. Most antidepressants, for example, won't take effect until about a month after starting them. In dealing with the fallout from your manic episode, knowledge is power. You can't change what you did, but you can learn and understand why you did it - why your mind was out of control. Strained and broken relationships are the most painful thing, and sometimes they never can be repaired. But as I'm learning, it's so important that you forgive yourself and move on from there. To keep wallowing in mortified guilt isn't going to get you anywhere. It just makes your offense look bigger and bigger in hindsight. Anyway I'm wishing you the best in all this. It's a tough road for sure, and things may get worse before they get better (I hope not!) but they will get better.
[S]
I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one

Having an episode of "going fast" turn into depression is so shocking. I have the bipolar and what has happened to you sounds familiar to me. I'm always telling people to analyze their childhood and make sure their depression isn't coming from the past. But sometimes, I think the body just goes into these cycles. I just went through a period of mania/insomnia for five days myself. I am on medication; lithium 450mg and navane 2mg. I did better on 600mg lithium but it made my intestines very sick after 7 years, so we cut it down. It's frustrating for you to have to put your life/plans on HOLD because of this MH interference. I can tell you it usually doesn't last forever because the body chemistry changes. You will get better, but nobody knows WHEN.

Seeking Advice: Hello. This time I'm seeking advice. I think the first time I'm doing so. How can I kill feelings and emotions inside? I wanna kill my sense of logic and thinking as well. In simple words, I want to become a robot. How can I do it?
[S]
The information I read earlier stated that this condition could be sparked by any substance / drug which "disagreed" with a patient. It cited sertraline and one other SSRI which had provided evidence of patients being diagnosed with this condition on withdrawl. So SSRIs can affect you too perhaps. There is perhaps less evidence with these drugs being less "heavy duty" than the anti-psychotics and perhaps having been observed less...particularly the newere SSRIs - of which Escitalopram is one. I knew about the reporting system and did indeed report the drug using the yellow card system. I have tried for several years to be taken seriously over this, and have ended up in the psychiatrist's chair! He seems determined to trash my concerns. The cardiologists were far quicker to consider psychiatric drugs as the cause, although they felt that what I suffered could not be termed "withdrawl symptoms." I am questioning whether it is worth the fight. I am much better now and, in terms of my heart, nothing can be done. It is better perhaps to come to terms with it, limit further derrogatory psychiatric investigations and to deal with the resulting increase in anxiety as best I can with therapy. Seeking help from professionals who use pills is the last thing that I want....so why turn to drug prescribers for advice and help? That's my view, although the bitterness and anger still burns very deeply I must admit.

you are not alone solitude every time i see cruelty i wish i could be less emotional ie burst into tear you would think with a mother like i had i would have had a thicker skin but alas no our emotions hurt as my voices tell me i am to have a balance and i like you are always analysing how are we to make sense of the world otherwise but not a robot - to look and see but not know

Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

advice in surviving suicidal thoughts: I've become a regular in posting here, on one hand it's good because I can share things I could not before, on the other hand it's like a sign of desperation and pain. I want advice from people who have experienced it or ones who are professionals - how do you survive these periods of intense feelings of hopelessness and desperation to the point of suicidal urges that are becoming increasingly prominent and terrifying. I'm trying to work with myself to achieve change for the better but I can't do it when I'm that hopeless. It's scary that I'm in this place and sometimes think that I have no choice except ending it all. I don't want to act on these thoughts but I just can't control them, it's like morbid thoughts. Please sharr from your experience.

I'm sorry you're feeling so terrible Imhotep That's such a hard place to be, when you're having suicidal thoughts, and everything seems hopeless. It's not lame at all to write about this here. Many people will relate to the place you find yourself in, many of us have been there too. I hope expressing here how you feel, and reaching out to others who might understand, will help a little. I'm glad you've posted what you did, it's better than keeping it to yourself, and struggling alone. If you feel in danger of acting on your suicidal thoughts please have a look at our page on getting help. It tells you who to contact if you need emergency medical help, plus other sources of support if you feel in crisis. There is also this article by one of our staff members on feeling suicidal that may be helpful to read. I hope things improve for you Imhotep. Do you have any support at the moment, anyone you can talk to? Please don't feel you have failed, you are at a really difficult time in your life, but that doesn't mean you are a failure. Try not to compare yourself to others, in my experience it has only made me feel worse about myself. And it's not comparing like with like. You are trying (and have tried hard in the past with different approaches) to find a way out, a way for things to feel better. I know it's hard, but please keep trying. Something will help, if you can find the right thing for you. I hope your anxiety lessens enough to let you get some sleep. Take care.

Your "fast" episode sounds a lot like classic mania. Everything is driven, sped up, bouncing wildly from one thing to another. Brilliant ideas that you realize later didn't even make sense. Not sleeping. With my Bipolar II diagnosis I don't experience mania quite to the extreme that you're describing - no psychosis etc., only on the lows - and it's called "hypomania." But even with that, I'm all too familiar with that sickening crash. It seems like at a certain point in a manic episode, your mind and body just plain run out of energy. No one can sustain that accelerated pace forever. For me actually it has never lasted longer than two weeks. And then you find yourself teetering on the edge. The smallest thing can trigger it, and before you know it, so rapidly that someone watching you could probably see it happen - you fall out of the sky. I have just recently pulled out of a very long and deep depressive episode that was triggered by my diagnosis and exacerbated by the mood stabilizer they put me on. The dosage, as it turns out, was too high; not only was it knocking off the highs, but it was flattening my mood at a level far below where it should have been. A simple change in dose of the same mood stabilizer, plus a different antidepressant, and I truly feel like a new person. Sadly, like your team told you, it just does take time. Different people respond in different ways to various medications and therapies, and it takes time just to see if a medication is working before trying something else. Most antidepressants, for example, won't take effect until about a month after starting them. In dealing with the fallout from your manic episode, knowledge is power. You can't change what you did, but you can learn and understand why you did it - why your mind was out of control. Strained and broken relationships are the most painful thing, and sometimes they never can be repaired. But as I'm learning, it's so important that you forgive yourself and move on from there. To keep wallowing in mortified guilt isn't going to get you anywhere. It just makes your offense look bigger and bigger in hindsight. Anyway I'm wishing you the best in all this. It's a tough road for sure, and things may get worse before they get better (I hope not!) but they will get better.

You don't trust him. That's not a good early sign for sure. Here's my two cents: Coming from someone who's been married and separated in that marriage, the best advice I've ever gotten is to never make any major decision regarding your relationship really fast or out of an emotional place. If you were already married, I'd say take sixmonths to a year before deciding to leave or stay. You are engaged, still a major commitment but with less weight. Maybe we'll say 3 months. Why? Because we tend to make the wisest decisions when we have time to think and let our emotions settle. You love him but don't trust him. You will need time to communicate and work on that in order to decide whether a marriage will work or not. If you need to postpone the wedding, by all means, postpone it. That may be a good time to tie in the conversation you'll have with him about trust. Avoid accusing him and use I statements." I'm struggling to trust you here. I'm reevaluating our relationship but I'd like to make it work,." Etc Whatever you do, do not just freak out and leave and call it off in one day. Do not make a decision out of hurt and being upset because you won't be truly ready to move on. It is good to stay with the one you love--- if after a time of careful consideration, you are confident you can be a team and face struggles together. Also, sex does not keep a marriage. If he loves you, he will be faithful. If he's unfaithful and loving it, no amount of sex can make him true to you. That being said, consider if there's something he's not getting from you that can be easily adjusted. Something like the level of respect you treat him with. A lot of men thrive off our respect in a relationship. Ive said a lot. Hope things work out.

reported my neighbour for child neglect and drugs: I'm feeling really sick right now. Thursday I reported my neighbour for the neglect of her 1 yr old. He screams 18 out of 24. There's no input with him he doesn't speak and he's stuck at home while the house in darkness as she never opens the blinds. She smokes cannabis from getting up to going to sleep. She then goes and puts the baby in the car and drives under the influence of drugs. Seriously causing me mental distress. I often disassociate as it causes me distress. I just couldn't cope I felt bad I had to tell my dr. So it's been reported to safe guarding department. But what happens next will they find out it's me and will they take her baby away. I wouldn't cope if they took him away. But I can't take it back. Please someone help me. I feel so bad and it's making me ill I'm taking it out on myself. I'm scared I'm going to do something bad to myself with the guilt. (Meaning self harm)

I feel okay. Like John Nash, I accept that my hallucinations are not real. They are not real people. So I can let them disappear in the distance. Do you think you could be projecting your feeings about breaking up with the child's mom onto the boy ?? Transferring your feelings onto a 7 month old baby is truly bad for the child. This is your son and he looks up to you. He is the wellspring of love. Let that love infect your being.  Adjusting to the idea that you are a parent for life, that is a big adjustment. No wonder you can't eat or sleep, this was a surprise for you, not a planned event.

I use to take neurontin and it not only made my hair fall out in clumps, it turned my very curly hair into straight hair. Now I'm having blurry vision from lithium. Before this I had severe GI distress from the lithium, so we cut the dosage down quite a bit. All the drugs have side effects. It's like I have a bad marriage to psychiatry; until death do us part.

completely hopeless: I don't know how I'll make it. When I feel like I tried everything and it doesn't help - therapy, medication, physical activity, everything. Nothing is helping, and suicidal thoughts are stronger than ever. When suicidal thoughts hit you there is know escape, I don't know how people overcome these places. I have tried to keeo it positive but I have completely collapsed mentally, I can't sleep even with pills, I feel like I am doomed. It is disappointing how I got to this place and that nothing have changed, I feel I have failed. I look at my family, friends, everybody is living their lives and I am stuck. I often think how they will react if I took my own life, how broken they will be, I just can't do this to them but the pain I'm experiencing right now is unbearable. Everything makes me feel bad and hopeless, and someone like me should have never reached this situation. This is the most hopeless and rock-bottom that I have ever felt. I wish I could change all this, change myself for the better, but I can't. The anxiety is too strong, I really don't know how I am going to survive and I feel so lame for writing this here.

I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one

My first post here. I'm looking for advice due to my neighbor who seems to have anger issues. For over a year now she has taken to shouting day in and day out at "Someone". I know its not me, I think its her ex-boyfriend who lives next door on the other side. Nothing unusual in that I guess but the problem is it is relentless, it never stops for days. This is having a detrimental effect on my own mental health as I cannot sleep when she is shouting. My Landlord doesn't care and, unlike an antisocial neighbor, she clearly has mental health issues so I don't want to complain to the council and get her evicted if she is already in poor mental health. So I don't know what to do. Currently I've had two days of this - without any break. She's even shouting at "Someone" while doing the housework. Some bad episodes she's often yelling at the top of her voice outside the next door but one. Sometimes bashing the door with a wheelie bin. The police have been round many times but they simply either don't care or don't want to get involved. I'm reluctant to go to her directly as I've been in the situation before where I have then become the object of their anger and had my car vandalised and attempted break ins. It's not as if she's a bad neighbour either as when she is, on the rare occasions placid, she has helped me. I feel I'm just stuck and there's nothing I can do. Currently I'm looking for a new flat before I get to the end of my tether but not a lot is available at my price point. Anyone got some help or advice for this kind of situation?

That sounds pretty tough, hang in their. It also sounds like you're maybe only ever seeing, or being around people, when the situation shows up the more negative sides of people. Shopping can be really infuriating, especially if people are ignorant and rude. Is there a way for you to get out and be around people in some way that doesn't directly involve you interacting or anything else that you don't want? Visiting certain places or going for walks or something maybe? It may help to slowly build a more positive picture of people and show you that they aren't always complete arseholes. I struggle with 'irritability' with people quite a lot, and I'm easily angered. One of the things that I've found useful is to use this website Self Help for Anger and use the resources available there. Two of the things that I find particularly helpful regarding anger and how I deal with it is to ask; How important will this be in 6 months time? - So for example, if someone does something stupid on the road, like pull out on me or something, and I get irate at that person, asking myself if it's something that would still be important to me in 6 months time really puts it into perspective that it's a minor thing and to forget it. And the other is asking yourself if something is 'fact or opinion'? Particularly useful if you have strong opinions about things, or thoughts about things that have happened. I'd get rid of the scewdriver. If you 'lose it' and end up pulling the screwdriver on someone, or maybe even using it, you could end up spending years in a prison cell, which I imagine would be infinitely worse than what you have now. Finally, are you on any medication at the minute, and are you in contact with anyone from the mental health team at all? Stay safe man.

Here a couple of things I'd say to offer some support (although I am by no means a licensed professional): 1. Structure - You noted to us that whenever you're alone, your anxiety and depression get the best of you. I'm the same way (minus the depression), because my OCD makes me obsess a lot over little things. In general, I would recommend structure. Get out more often, find things to fill your time with—that are healthy—and do your best to lead a productive life. 2. Finding a Job - Finding a job sounds like it will be essential to your recovery path. What I would recommend is asking your clinical supports (e.g counselor) if there are any rehab programs that help mentally ill people find employment. In my state of Massachusetts, we have an organization called MRC that does just that. My hope is that those options will be made available to you. However, I would also say to take it easy. While money is a present problem for you, putting too much pressure on yourself over finding a job while you're already on a bumpy road will exacerbate your symptoms. You want to ensure you're stable going into a job. 3. Coping Skills - Coping skills are also imperative to your overall mental health. Everyone needs them. When you have moments of self-doubt, ask yourself some questions: "What makes this not my fault?" "What can I do to help myself?" Something else that will help is giving yourself self-soothing. Coloring, writing, drawing, listening to music, meditation, and exercise are all healthy examples of coping mechanisms that are recommended by clinical professionals. They keep us feeling strong and help us keep our minds in the right place. 4. Give Yourself a Break - You're not to blame for everything. It really is unfortunate that you've lost so many people, and I'm very sorry that all of these difficulties are piling up on your shoulders, but there is a lot of hope still in store for you. You have to be easy on yourself, and recognize that we're only human. Pace your recovery and make sure your counselor is aware of how you feel. If you need any further encouragement or support, let me know!

Anyone have a relative living with dementia?: Dementia touches a lot of people's lives, so is there anyone who wishes to talk about it on here? Just a thought
[S]
Have you read my intro in the front page? I only mention it as you can look out for the Home doing good care for your gran. It is sad to be the relative of someone living with dementia, but in knowing a little of what you can do and better understand, can be helpful, I hope.

I’m alone too - a widow - and find travelling and socialising especially hard. I am learning to cope and can now travel around by train and across London without any help. I do still get nervous but have decided to keep going anyway as I can have panic attacks just in the house when I am not under any pressure. The trick in my case has been to write down every single aspect of the journey before hand. Time I need to leave the house, time of bus, time of train, carriage and seat number. VERY precise directions about each stage of the journey - get off train, turn left to ticket barrier, turn left to station exit etc. And I tick off each stage when it is managed. It is more a case of managing the fear rather than overcoming it. And it can go wrong. On my last trip the train station was having some reconstruction work done and I ended up at an exit I didn’t recognise - in the dark!!!! Happened over a week ago and I am only just recovering. The other thing that helps, if you have a mobile phone, have some support back up from an understanding friend or relative who can talk you through the situation if things do come totally unstuck.

Hyperventilation: I don't remember if I've asked this question before, yet I'm sorry if I have. I've read on different sites that an anxiety attack, also called panic attack, causes hyperventilation. The thing is I tend to hyperventilate all the time and I also feel short of breath at every moment of the day. I yawn as a reason, I sigh as well and I also take random deep breaths (and after those randomly-timed deep breaths I feel my lungs are finally getting oxygen) potentially at every moment. All these symptoms have no roots in any physical problems. My question is whether this is still possible to be related to anxiety? I wish you all a great time.
[S]
I do have anxiety and it is pretty severe. What is confusing me is that they say anxiety attacks bring about hyperventilation and many other symptoms I show and I rarely get those attacks, I avoid most situations. This is how I can explain the confusion at my best. There are those times when people have panic attacks and they show signs like hyperventilation. I do have anxiety and I always experience hyperventilation, not only at the time of a panic attack. Is hyperventilation bound to those times one experiences panic attacks?
[S]
Try to meditate and take deep long breaths in moments like this. Let the racing thoughts come and go, they will eventually decelerate.
[S]
I am thinking that anxiety can be related to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress and anxiety We can have chronic metabolic acidosis, which includes anxiety due to hypoxia as one of its symptoms. Increased breathing compensates for the acidity by decreasing carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Panic attacks may indicate a problem with pH, which is compensated for by hyperventilation. Over compensation can result in alkalosis. I think this can be caused by a chronic poor diet, such as a typical western diet. Eating nutrient rich foods helped me lose my anxiety, as well as avoiding caffeine, sugar, sodas. Antioxidants, such as lemon juice, may be helping also. A Magnesium deficiency can also related to anxiety (and depression, insomnia), and I am trying to keep topped up with epsom salt baths. What you are describing sounds quite like Kussmaul breathing a symptom of severe metabolic acidosis.

My uncommon, irrational fear: I have three fears that I group together into a “fear of things moving that shouldn’t move” which sounds weird, but that’s just what I’ve always called this. Let me explain: Ever since I was really young, I’ve been so scared of things that sway (wind chimes, swing sets, hanging stuff, those giant inflatable flailing tubes that car dealerships always have), and toys that move (my neighbours had this little Christmas tree that opened its mouth and moved its hands that used to make me cry). As I grew up, these fears grew worse; I can’t sleep when it’s windy, as I know things outside are blowing around, I hate the thought of hair blowing in the wind, so I cut mine short, I took the drawstrings out of my hoodies, and I developed a fear of things floating in water (my grandparents live next to the ocean, so when we go boating, I have panic attacks thinking about floating around). My whole life, my friends and parents have made fun of me, and it’s honestly annoying that I fear going new places, as I won’t be able to prepare myself for things that may be hanging. I don’t have much else to say, but I’ll share some stories. In high school, my art teacher had to take all the kids art projects hanging from the ceiling down, as I expressed my discomfort to her. I can’t go in pools, as floaties give me awful anxiety; I go around and throw them out of the water if I can. When servers at restaurants accidentally hit the hanging lights above a table, I can never go back to that restaurant. I don’t go to one friend of my dads house, as she has huge vertical blinds that constantly move When I take a shirt off a hanger, I have to hold the hanger until it stops swinging, and if it hit another hanger, I freak out. I avoid the toy aisles in stores for obvious reasons. I’m tired of all these things running my life, does anyone know what I can do?

I’m sorry you are feeling like you are worthless and I know – I’ve been there. The reality is you are worth so very much and I hope you can begin to see this. You are uniquely gifted and you have a story to tell and a part to play in your own life and in others’. Many people in your position are not sensitive to how their problems affect others. You care about your husband’s reactions to your situation and that is a hopeful sign – you have not withdrawn into yourself. You are aware of how you feel; ask yourself how this is impacting your behavior, and also what you are doing to change your situation. You need action here. Have you talked to your family doctor? You have a psychiatrist – do you consider them an effective help? If not, try someone else but keep persevering. Have you tried simply a counselor? If you’re on medication, do you stay on track with it? These are all positive things you can do to help yourself. Once you feel you’re moving forward, talk this over with your husband. He loves you and I’m sure is concerned and would be encouraged.
[S]
I’d also look into why exactly this is causing you stress... being asked to sit with workmates, teambuilding lunches, it doesn’t sound like it should be causing stress. Similarly it’s kind of normal to be open to a certain extent when with others. So if this is causing you stress, perhaps there is some other underlying cause? What Poopy Doll said about the forces is also probably right, that the kind of attitudes towards “building character” there are even more old school then at other institutions. It’s worth thinking about what you are letting yourself in for...
[S]
My view on this is that everyone goes through life doing the best that they can, given the background that circumstances and their parents gave them. Perhaps that psychiatrist was abused as a child, you don’t know. But I feel that people inherently do what they can to make a good life for themselves and their loved ones. So when we come across people who hurt us, it’s often that they are carrying out patterns that they have inherited from their parents, teachers and so on. The whole process of rectifying these things, of introducing greater compassion and removing old inherited harm, is something that psychologists have been working at for ages. The process of working through our own trauma is something that takes time. Finding ways to love ourselves, forgive ourselves for things we did which in hindsight were maybe not right, accept ourselves in the present moment and in the past, these things are all difficult but very worthwhile. It’s good to spend time and effort on introspection, on why things are the way they are, and finding some love for that boy with Tourette’s.

Insomnia...help! I have generalized anxiety disorder, I've had it since I was a kid. But a couple years ago, it started affecting my sleep. I talked to my psychiatrist about it and she prescribed me clonazapam for a short period which put me right out, but she eventually took me off it so I wouldn't become addicted. She then prescribed me Valium which in the beginning was helpful, but now it's not doing much for me. Now, I take 15mg of Valium, 10mg of Ambien, 3-4 over the counter sleep-aids (doxylamine succinate) and 3 melatonins...and this barely puts me to sleep, sometimes I still am tossing and turning or staring at the clock. Does anyone experience this? Does anyone have any other tips on how I can combat this without all these pills? I've tried meditation, establishing a routine, drinking chamomile tea, and none of this works. Please someone help!
[S]
The information I read earlier stated that this condition could be sparked by any substance / drug which "disagreed" with a patient. It cited sertraline and one other SSRI which had provided evidence of patients being diagnosed with this condition on withdrawl. So SSRIs can affect you too perhaps. There is perhaps less evidence with these drugs being less "heavy duty" than the anti-psychotics and perhaps having been observed less...particularly the newere SSRIs - of which Escitalopram is one. I knew about the reporting system and did indeed report the drug using the yellow card system. I have tried for several years to be taken seriously over this, and have ended up in the psychiatrist's chair! He seems determined to trash my concerns. The cardiologists were far quicker to consider psychiatric drugs as the cause, although they felt that what I suffered could not be termed "withdrawl symptoms." I am questioning whether it is worth the fight. I am much better now and, in terms of my heart, nothing can be done. It is better perhaps to come to terms with it, limit further derrogatory psychiatric investigations and to deal with the resulting increase in anxiety as best I can with therapy. Seeking help from professionals who use pills is the last thing that I want....so why turn to drug prescribers for advice and help? That's my view, although the bitterness and anger still burns very deeply I must admit.

I was diagnosed with psychotic episodes around the age 24 - I was also prescribed anti depressants, and i feel my diagnosis was closer to psychotic depression. My depression started in my late teens. The depression did lift but the psychotic features remained - i am still psychotic 18 years later.
[S]
It's very serious, yes. But It's possible to resolve the problem. Health emotional surrounding, physical exercises and meditation should do the treatment. But the trick is you should be persistent and do it every single day. Another effective way is hypnosis. There're audio podcasts on the web. Ny favorite is this one Sleep Hypnopill - Best Self Hypnosis Audio for Insomnia, Deep Sleep Hypnotherapy

I have been struggling so so much with my fiance at the moment. We have been together for 3 years and are due to get married next september - something ive always looked forward too but lately i just want to cancel it. When we first got together he was still dating another girl who he continued to see for 6 months into our relationship - he says just as a friend and nothing ever happened between them but he always hid it from me. He always pretended he didnt know and he forgot etcetc. After one year i found out he was watching porn. Every night. Now a lot of people have said that thats normal as he is a young guy and what not. But when i confronted him about it he told me its because im not good enough. Since this he has stopped watching the porn and we have a very good sex life - at times. There are times where he wants it constantly then there are others where we can go a month with no sex and it doesnt bother him. We bought our own house in march of this year and in may i found a pair of pants. Just simple black pants. But they are not mine as i couldnt get them passed my knees. He laughed it off and said they are probably my sisters.. who is bigger than me. We ended up having a couple of weeks apart after this because i was so so sure he had cheated on me. He still has never admitted anything to me and still denies everything. Lately he has been coming home really late. Friday he should of finished work at 1:30 but didnt come home until 6 as he 'worked late again' which has now been 5 days in a row. He is very protective of his phone. Even if he is trying to show me something and i go to hold the phone he pulls it away from me so i cant even hold the phone. He keeps telling me its all in my head and i think a lot of it is but i dont know what to do anymore. I love him more than anything in the world and i couldnt imagine my life without him yet this is all destroying me! I just need a lie detector machine or something to prove that he is or isnt telling me the truth

My ex-boyfriend has Asperger's. He is highly intelligent, focused and methodical, with an odd, very dry sense of humour. He's quiet and awkward around people and often talked about not being able to show emotion like he thought was proper. Like me, social situations make him anxious. He has often been depressed and irritable but I don't recall any sudden mood swings.
[S]
You don't trust him. That's not a good early sign for sure. Here's my two cents: Coming from someone who's been married and separated in that marriage, the best advice I've ever gotten is to never make any major decision regarding your relationship really fast or out of an emotional place. If you were already married, I'd say take sixmonths to a year before deciding to leave or stay. You are engaged, still a major commitment but with less weight. Maybe we'll say 3 months. Why? Because we tend to make the wisest decisions when we have time to think and let our emotions settle. You love him but don't trust him. You will need time to communicate and work on that in order to decide whether a marriage will work or not. If you need to postpone the wedding, by all means, postpone it. That may be a good time to tie in the conversation you'll have with him about trust. Avoid accusing him and use I statements." I'm struggling to trust you here. I'm reevaluating our relationship but I'd like to make it work,." Etc Whatever you do, do not just freak out and leave and call it off in one day. Do not make a decision out of hurt and being upset because you won't be truly ready to move on. It is good to stay with the one you love--- if after a time of careful consideration, you are confident you can be a team and face struggles together. Also, sex does not keep a marriage. If he loves you, he will be faithful. If he's unfaithful and loving it, no amount of sex can make him true to you. That being said, consider if there's something he's not getting from you that can be easily adjusted. Something like the level of respect you treat him with. A lot of men thrive off our respect in a relationship. Ive said a lot. Hope things work out.

I suffered from terrible head shaking and blinking as a child when going through relentless physical and mental abuse off parents, family members and other kids my age, it got to the point i couldn't concentrate on anything because of it and the abuse i got off people got even worse because of it. I thought it was me with the problem and blamed myself for years. When i started reading psychology books in my late teens and into my 20s then i woke up to the problem not being me, it was all the bastards giving me shit all my life. I took control of my life and read up on all kinds of subjects then became confident to the pint of arrogance and i showed noting but contempt to all and anyone who tried to put me down. My ticks stopped and for the last 20 years i only ever get them if i am stressed. i find they stop when i try not to focus on them, forget you have ticks and they seem to go away, or at least thats what i have found over the years.

Family reaction: Hello. I am new here and have joined in the hope that I can discuss things with people who have been through similar things. My question for today relates to how your family has reacted to your anxiety/depression. In short, I suffer on and off from both and have done for many years but was formally diagnosed about 2.5 years ago. I used anti depressants for 2 years and was lucky enough to borrow some money from a supportive family member to pay to see a therapist and am now coping much better. But on first opening up to the other side of my family, I was met with disinterest at best and cruelty at worst. From an general lack of asking how I was to saying things like anxiety doesn't exist, I had made it up, my therapist had put ideas in my head and that I was too confused, lying about the causes. Sadly much of my problem has stemmed from interaction with these family members over the years so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. I don't need to tell you how painful and all consuming mental health issues can be, the worst few years were honestly the hardest thing I've ever gone through. So I have cut off these family members to protect myself from comments that perpetuated my issues, only to be tormented by further hurtful comments and ill feeling towards me from both them and other family. I struggle to understand how anyone could be so cruel to someone who is clearly suffering (and then question the decision for no contact). Perhaps they just don't understand, I will never really know. I am struggling today with the injustice of being treated so badly then being the villain for stepping away from them. Has anyone else experienced this? I'd be so interested to know how you've dealt with any feelings of guilt or anger or just that I am not the only one who has gone through this.
[S]
Your story is not unusual. A lot of people who post complain about dis-interested and toxic family members. My experience is similar. A lot of people are just brainwashed and don't think. You need to think independently to break through the mainstream thought process. It is a step too far for some people who are just on autopilot. A lot are obsessed with money or power, or just their own little bubble. In reality, few people really care or understand. Work towards your strengths, keep grounded and lucid, and treat your toxic family with caution and contempt.

So sorry, this is very hard for parents. We love our children unconditionally and deeply...and it hurts us to see them hurt themselves. It is good that she is seeing a psychologist. Perhaps you and your husband want to consider seeing a therapist together to talk about how to handle the specific issues that are coming up. You still want to parent your child and that may require discipline to continue to form her into a responsible adult. It might help to get support in the best approach to doing this. There may also be parent support groups for parents dealing with these issues. She is only fifteen, it is understandable that you are concerned about who she is socializing with. Kids at this age can be very persuaded and influenced. You and your husband need support right now. This may also lead to family counseling where the three of you can openly discuss issues and perhaps understand the needs of each other. You are the parents, it is wise not to ignore the signs that something is not right or that your daughter might be making poor choices. If you belong to a church, perhaps you can speak to the pastor. You love her and want the best for her. Children at 15 are not able to know what is best. I hope you can find the resources you need to get through this. Stay strong!


[P]
I can't get over something my manager and my mum said. I can't stop over thinking and obsessing about it. How can I get over it? I have been depressed for a few months now and just recently decided to go back to my old singing teacher for singing lessons. I was a bit nervous to see her again because it had been so many years. I thought that was very normal and to be expected. I had not seen her in about 3 years. So we met for the lesson and as we were talking out of nowhere out of the blue she said "it's not good to be so not sure all the time". I was already feeling very depressed and I found this very insulting. So I came home and told my mum (im still living at home and thought she would comfort me). Instead she said something that made me feel so much worse, she kind of agreed with my singing teacher and said "yeah you should be sure", "why not tell your teacher you are sure". The problem is I wasn't even sure what she was talking about. But the whole experience made me feel like its not ok to be "not sure" at times. Like, doesn't everyone go through times of uncertainty and change in their life where they are very unsure? Isn't it ok to be not sure or indecisive? I keep getting attacked by my singing teacher over this and feel very hurt and bullied. A lot of other students feel this way about her as well and myself and one other stopped going to lessons there. But what she said still bothers me. Is it ok to be not sure, aren't we all not sure at times? I'm in between jobs at the moment and employment is a bit uncertain. I feel not sure about what my next job is going to be, or how I'm going to use my degree. I guess im unsure about lots of things in life. My mum said something that implied this wasn't normal. She said something that drove me crazy, it really hurt and I haven't been able to get over it for weeks. She said I should always say I'm sure about things, even if I am not sure. I was going to sing at a gig my singing teacher offered me to sing at, but I didn't really feel ready yet to sing at it. I didn't really feel up for it. And even if I eventually would have been ready to sing at, I was so depressed that I didn't want to. Mum said just say you are sure (when I hadn't even practiced yet or rehearsed the song). It really upset me and made me so angry and I haven't been able to shake it. I've always been the kind of person who is confident enough to be honest. If I am not sure about something yet, I just say I'm not sure yet, I'm sure I'll be ready on the day I'm just not ready yet. I guess I just feel very attacked over this personality trait of mine. It makes me feel depressed that people are criticising something about who I am. I guess my questions are 1) Is it ok to be not sure at times? Aren't we all in life? 2) Isn't it more normal to say straight up. 'I'm not sure yet but will be ready on the day'. Why won't my mum listen to a different point of view? 3) Is it normal to disagree with your parents over fundamental life principles like this? Is it weird I don't agree with her about this? 4) what should I do to get over this / Stop obsessing about it and move on?
[S]
I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one
[S]
1) It's absolutely perfectly ok and normal to not be sure at times or even most or all the time. 2) Yes it's normal to be honest and say you are not sure but also it's best to say you are not sure if you really are not sure. Imagine this situation: An athlete call Bob hasn't had much training and has been eating junk food, and his trainer asks if he wants to participate in an up coming race. Bob now has two choices, be honest with his trainer or lie and say he is ready. So what you did it's correct. It's always best to be honest. 3) Yea i would say it;s normal to disagree with your family/siblings/parents about principals, philosophies, in regards to life. I'm different to both my parents in my life view and principals. Some people are similar to their parents, but others are not. 4) Just know that you have not done anything wrong and that you should be proud that you have a great quality in being honest. You know yourself best. And hopefully then you can put this behind you. And also know that you can always ask on this forum for an opinion or to vent about life. We are not judgemental here and we will always support one another.

That being said, consider if there's something he's not getting from you that can be easily adjusted. Something like the level of respect you treat him with. A lot of men thrive off our respect in a relationship. Ive said a lot. Hope things work out.

Bullying: I recently read about a person bullied by pupils and teachers and the way she solved the problem by moving schools. Why is it that the bullies always get protected? Those who bullied should have been held accountable. It's like the victims of bullying are often made to have counselling this is not right it is the bullies if anyone who should be made to take counselling. That then might solve the problem.
[S]
It's often because the parents are powerful and schools don't want to run the risk of making such powerful enemies. That only fuels their power rush though as they think they're invincible. On the other side of the spectrum though and much like what you said about how they need counselling, if they're having problems at home that are causing this bullying nature the school doesn't want to get involved.
[S]
Not sure what to say here too. But I was bullied a lot too. Some stupid guys used to touch my butt- I was that fat girl who had no bf. It was so embarrassing... First step, is to tell someone about it. Talking about it is a huge relief. Since he has other victims, please, you need to tell someone who can do something-like the police. Have you tried therapy? It's a good way to forget about deep fears - 3 years ago a teacher told me to commit suicide, that I wasn't worth it. That made me deeply depressed, more than I was already, and I associate school with bad things, that's why I'm homeschooled, I just couldn't keep going. I've been to therapy. There is improvement, but you just don't forget about something so bad like that. But it helps!If you want, message me. I'm a good listener!
[S]
I don't think removing her from the bullying environment is such a good idea. What happens when she has to enter the real world. She can't hide from everything. I suggest getting her to a therapist who can help her to develop coping strategies to deal with the bullying and whatever else is going on with her at school. Also, I don't know your level of schooling yourself, but if she wants to get into college, I am not sure that homeschooling is a proper amount of credit to get her enrolled. I don't know, but that is something you might want to look into. Often times, people look to solve the problem right in front of them instead of looking for a long term solution.

Scary symptoms of anxiety?? I have suffered with anxiety for about 4 years now. The thing I can't bare about anxiety is the scary symptoms that it causes! Not sure if anyone else gets this but I started getting muscle twitches (which have thankfully almost disappeared) and I also get pins and needles sensations in my finger tips, sometimes goes up my hand, in my feet that have on occasion gone up my leg. The only way I get rid of these symptoms is by distraction. I have health anxiety so bad and every little symptom I feel, convinces me that it's another serious illness. It affects my home life, sometimes my work life and just makes me feel like I'm going round the bend! I obsess over every little thing, it makes me so mad at myself....oh to be "normal"
[S]
I completely understand how you feel. i have such bad health anxiety that any little ache or twinge sets me off. i agree get yourself checked out for ease of mind more than anything. The only problem i have atm is sometimes i find it extremely difficult to come away from these physical symptoms such as i get currently severe shakes to the point my body wont relax. It makes me stress out more. i wish you all the best in your battle. take every day as it is. Things will get better.
[S]
Here a couple of things I'd say to offer some support (although I am by no means a licensed professional): 1. Structure - You noted to us that whenever you're alone, your anxiety and depression get the best of you. I'm the same way (minus the depression), because my OCD makes me obsess a lot over little things. In general, I would recommend structure. Get out more often, find things to fill your time with—that are healthy—and do your best to lead a productive life. 2. Finding a Job - Finding a job sounds like it will be essential to your recovery path. What I would recommend is asking your clinical supports (e.g counselor) if there are any rehab programs that help mentally ill people find employment. In my state of Massachusetts, we have an organization called MRC that does just that. My hope is that those options will be made available to you. However, I would also say to take it easy. While money is a present problem for you, putting too much pressure on yourself over finding a job while you're already on a bumpy road will exacerbate your symptoms. You want to ensure you're stable going into a job. 3. Coping Skills - Coping skills are also imperative to your overall mental health. Everyone needs them. When you have moments of self-doubt, ask yourself some questions: "What makes this not my fault?" "What can I do to help myself?" Something else that will help is giving yourself self-soothing. Coloring, writing, drawing, listening to music, meditation, and exercise are all healthy examples of coping mechanisms that are recommended by clinical professionals. They keep us feeling strong and help us keep our minds in the right place. 4. Give Yourself a Break - You're not to blame for everything. It really is unfortunate that you've lost so many people, and I'm very sorry that all of these difficulties are piling up on your shoulders, but there is a lot of hope still in store for you. You have to be easy on yourself, and recognize that we're only human. Pace your recovery and make sure your counselor is aware of how you feel. If you need any further encouragement or support, let me know!
[S]
You may already have done so but I think is a good idea to get any symptoms checked out to ensure there is nothing physical behind them. Therapy such as cbt can sometimes help to cope with symptoms of health anxiety.

Germphobia, opening up for the first time. Hi, I've had a germphobia for around 5 years now, for so long I kept it to myself and tried to deal with it in myself, I kept to myself for so long as to I was and still am embarrassed by it. I also thought I could get rid of it on my own. I have looked over what I wrote and it's quite lengthly, if you are able to give your time to give it a read and any response I would appreciate it a lot! It has gotten to the stage now I've had it for so long and it has effected my life bad, I've decided enough is enough I need to speak out in some way and try and seek help. It is something I've some what had a denial to by thinking I could get it to go away and telling myself "I don't want there to be something wrong with me" I had dealt with it on my own for a long while until others around me had noticed, the only person I can open up to and talk about it to is my girlfriend who has been so helpful and done so much for me, although I can open up and talk to her about it there is still some stuff I feel embarrassed of and can't tell her. Apologies for the long essay this is just the first I'm getting it properly of my chest and have so much to say. When I was younger I was never afraid of germs, it is something that started effecting me while I was in hospital for a few days, my brother pointed out about germs such as MRSA and me touching things and eating etc as like I said I had no issue with germs. From here it sort of got into my head and from what I can remember I suddenly had a fear of germs from when I wasn't in hospital, I wouldn't wear my clothes I had wore in hospital etc. Now hospital germs do not bother me at all and I've came now to be extremely afraid of toilet germs, I was on holiday and hadn't noticed our toilet was leaking from the bottom, a pair of my shorts ended up being soaked from the leaking toilet, I just got changed and brought the soaked shorts home with me and washed them when home and continued to wear them and clothes from my case without an issue. One day I was working and got some cat fieces on a cloth I was using to clean, I had a sore head after this and someone told me about toxoplasmosis and it's effects, this is when I started worrying about germs again. After a while I had a fear of germs from the toilet and would not wear any of my clothes from the holiday I had been on although I had wore them a lot before hearing about toxoplasmosis without a worry, I also wouldn't wear clothes that had been in drawers etc with those clothes as I felt they were contaminated. One day I went to the toilet and got splashed by toilet water, I started worrying about this, when i got homemade I washed my clothes then I started thinking the washing machine was contaminated and couldn't wash clothes in that washing machine but I could use towels my mum had washed in the washing machine to dry myself but could it wear the clothes. With my mum and dad wearing clothes they had washed in there as well as touching my clothes I felt were contaminated I began to feel like they were covered in germs, these germs from the toilet I fear; in my head spread, for example all over a person, all over a surface. If I get splashed my toilet water I would have to get showered for a very long time and throw out the shower gel I had used and clothes I was wearing etc. I regularly showered for very long periods and washed my hands for long periods when I felt dirty. I then began to feel like I couldn't eat stuff cooked in my parents house. I decided to move out to get away from the germs because it was really effecting my life and had essentially ruined it. I love my family but because of my phobia I stayed away from them for 2 years and didn't see them as I felt they were covered in germs. For around 6 months I was living with it well, I had a new job and wasn't able to go about my daily life again, then suddenly I was back to the bad fear, this then caused me to leave my job and eventually had me living in an actually germy environment, I would go days without getting washed as I felt I had no clean clothes I could wear, I wouldn't wash doe dirty surfaces, the house I was renting became a real dirty place that someone without s germphobia couldn't live in. I've since moved out and am back in my parents and seeing my family and don't feel like they are covered in germs anymore, my girlfriend and I got a new house closer to my parents and where I grew up but was alightly afraid of moving in because the toilet was right beside the bath/shower and was worried that by flushing the toilet that small amounts toilet water would sometimes splash into the bath. My girlfriends family have been in our old house (the one that got extremely dirty to the extent it was unliveable) as it belongs to a relative of theirs, my girlfriend cleaned it when we moved out as she knew I was unable and freaked out at the thought of it, although she cleaned the house I can't feel the house is clean as it was extremely dirty at the end when we moved out, her mum is a cleaner and gave it a proper clean when we moved out as would be when majority of tenancys end. Since then her mum got us a tv from her friend for our new house, I thought I was ok with it and got it brought to our house, now it's on our new house I feel like it isn't covered in germs and now my house is covered in germs, I've had the house for 3 months and haven't moved in because of this and have been trying to get over it myself but I'm realising I can't and I need help. Her family began to around a year ago I had a germphobia and now I'm home again my family have noticed and my mum has tried to get me to speak to my doctor but I didn't want to as I felt embarrassed and kind of didn't want anth to admit there was "something wrong with me". I know the phobia is silly and it's all on my head, but as much as I know that it's really silly I can't get over it. Sorry for such a long story just thought I would get it all out as this is the first I've opened up about it. If anyone could helped I would appreciate it so much as my life has basically been ruined from it. Also if anyone needs any help or to talk also I'm happy to help others in anyway.

I also have a problem with spending. I buy too many clothes, craft supplies, food. Sometimes it's fun, there's a bit of a high that I get when I buy something that's not a pure necessity, but then I feel anxious again about having spent so much money. There are 2 places where I shop that have a rewards program, and I always get promotions in emails for points on food and various other items, some of which are necessities, and others, not so much. I'm going to have to reign in my spending now, because I am jobless and back in university for another year.

You are a young adult and need your own space, especially with going to med school. You might need to sit down with mom and have a heart to heart talk with her. Explain how difficult med school is and the amount of work required to be successful. She might also need to come to realize that all work and no play is a formula for failure. Remember it is her house and she is doubling as a landlord. It is a difficult situation for both of you.Perhaps you can agree on some things you can do around the house that would be acceptable to both of you. Be firm , loving and prepared when you approach her. Be sure to choose a good time for both of you where you are both relaxed and open to the conversation.

Any jumpers irritate me a little, same with woollen hats, and scarves. When I was a kid, the feeling of having hair down my back after a haircut made me so upset I'd have to have my hair cut at home so I could instantly go into the shower, and I'd refuse to wear the shirt I got my hair cut in no matter how many times it was washed. Nowadays I'm much better about that, but it's still a bit annoying to me.

Hair loss: I've been on antipsychotic meds for mental health for almost a decade and I have suffered from hair loss for a long time. I think the meds are making my hair fall out, I just wanted to know if there is anyone else experiencing this.
[S]
I have been suffering from hair loss for like 6 months as I had bariatric surgery. I lost like half of my hair, but today my boss told me of injections of B12 that helped her with the hair loss. Maybe it's something you could ask about your doctor?
[S]
Ablify is at least one I know of that makes hair fall out. It made my hair fall out in clumps and bits and no one believed me. It was horrible. So, yeah some medications can cause hair loss. Talk to your doctor about it. If it is the medication it will grow back after stopping it.
[S]
I use to take neurontin and it not only made my hair fall out in clumps, it turned my very curly hair into straight hair. Now I'm having blurry vision from lithium. Before this I had severe GI distress from the lithium, so we cut the dosage down quite a bit. All the drugs have side effects. It's like I have a bad marriage to psychiatry; until death do us part.

Feel like giving up: Hi and sorry in advance for my first post but I just don't know what to do. In the last year I have lost my father, gran, uncle, godparents, best friend and several other friends from cancer/accidents. Despite putting on a brave face and returning to work, my boss who knows about everything has been bullying me. I've been told to take action but I'm not strong enough despite plenty of evidence and witnesses. I'm on citalopram and speak to a specialist counsellor every fortnight but every time I'm alone my anxiety and depression take over. I have resigned due to the bullying. I just couldn't cope with it this year. No job to go to. A disabled brother to care for. Money worries. I just feel like giving up. There really is no joy in waking up. Feel like a total failure and have no idea how I can get through this

Here a couple of things I'd say to offer some support (although I am by no means a licensed professional): 1. Structure - You noted to us that whenever you're alone, your anxiety and depression get the best of you. I'm the same way (minus the depression), because my OCD makes me obsess a lot over little things. In general, I would recommend structure. Get out more often, find things to fill your time with—that are healthy—and do your best to lead a productive life. 2. Finding a Job - Finding a job sounds like it will be essential to your recovery path. What I would recommend is asking your clinical supports (e.g counselor) if there are any rehab programs that help mentally ill people find employment. In my state of Massachusetts, we have an organization called MRC that does just that. My hope is that those options will be made available to you. However, I would also say to take it easy. While money is a present problem for you, putting too much pressure on yourself over finding a job while you're already on a bumpy road will exacerbate your symptoms. You want to ensure you're stable going into a job. 3. Coping Skills - Coping skills are also imperative to your overall mental health. Everyone needs them. When you have moments of self-doubt, ask yourself some questions: "What makes this not my fault?" "What can I do to help myself?" Something else that will help is giving yourself self-soothing. Coloring, writing, drawing, listening to music, meditation, and exercise are all healthy examples of coping mechanisms that are recommended by clinical professionals. They keep us feeling strong and help us keep our minds in the right place. 4. Give Yourself a Break - You're not to blame for everything. It really is unfortunate that you've lost so many people, and I'm very sorry that all of these difficulties are piling up on your shoulders, but there is a lot of hope still in store for you. You have to be easy on yourself, and recognize that we're only human. Pace your recovery and make sure your counselor is aware of how you feel. If you need any further encouragement or support, let me know!
[S]
A lot of people don't seem to be able to understand depression. The pain a clinically depressed person can be the same as a person that has had X happen to them. The thing is we can't control it, we are brave strong people that face those feelings every day without giving up. Your mom was so wrong to say those things to you. Facebook always gets me down because people don't respond to my posts. I hope things with your mom work out the way you want them to.

Mental illness has no prejudice and can affect anyone. It's just that an illness. I attempted suicide 2 years ago, and thankfully regretted it and called 911 to save myself. I still have thoughts of suicide, but last month my step father committed suicide and after dealing with the loss, unanswered questions and witnessing what this has done to my mother I just can not ever do it no matter what thoughts I have. When I attempted one of my daughters was home and since my step dad did it all I can think of is how I made my daughter feel that day, and when the thoughts come instantly I see her face and I am so thankful. You are not lame for writing on this forum, you are brave and a lot stronger than you think. It doesn't seem like your meds are working. Maybe tell your doc that you don't think they are working, your having irrational thoughts, or something like that. I know you don't want to probably say suicidal thoughts because then they will put you in the hospital, so just think of a clever way to say that. Also, are you anxiety, depression, bipolar?


[P]
Anxiety? Not sure what to do! Helloo everyone 😊 just joined and this is my first post. I’m currently at university and spend a lot of my time on placement within a hospital. I’ve been there for about a year and 3 months. During this time I’ve gone from absolutely loving what I do to panicking when it comes to putting a mask on and getting scrubbed! I have had some issues... mainly the person in charge of me tends to go out of their way to make things difficult for me. I tend to keep myself to myself regarding my personal life and this is apparently causing problems because this particular person thinks I should be more open (and gossip). The other students in my group don’t really bother with me much because of this particular person saying stuff about me. I had my end of year test which I had to prepare for all by myself as they offered me no help unlike the other students. Spoken to uni about it and basically got told to man up. I go all sweaty and dizzy and start to feel sickly. It’s awful. Recently this week I’ve been set ‘targets’ by this person... this includes me sitting with our group of students whilst in lecturers rather than sitting with my friends. I also have to meet with them for a teambuilding lunch on my day off each week. I’m going to speak to Uni tomorrow to see if there is anything I can do. I’ve tried asking for a change of placement and they refused saying it would be character building for me. I honestly feel so fed up. I get panicky just being on a bus or in a shop! I feel like I’m a shadow of my former self. I avoid situations where I know I will panic 😩 I don’t want to go to the doctor if I can help it as I’m hoping to go in the forces once I qualify. Any help would be greatly appreciated
[S]
I’m sorry you are feeling like you are worthless and I know – I’ve been there. The reality is you are worth so very much and I hope you can begin to see this. You are uniquely gifted and you have a story to tell and a part to play in your own life and in others’. Many people in your position are not sensitive to how their problems affect others. You care about your husband’s reactions to your situation and that is a hopeful sign – you have not withdrawn into yourself. You are aware of how you feel; ask yourself how this is impacting your behavior, and also what you are doing to change your situation. You need action here. Have you talked to your family doctor? You have a psychiatrist – do you consider them an effective help? If not, try someone else but keep persevering. Have you tried simply a counselor? If you’re on medication, do you stay on track with it? These are all positive things you can do to help yourself. Once you feel you’re moving forward, talk this over with your husband. He loves you and I’m sure is concerned and would be encouraged.
[S]
I’m so sorry for what you’re experiencing right now. I want to encourage you to seek help and support from your family and friends or consider to join a support group where you can meet face to face. It will help you not to feel isolated and alone. Consult with your doctor regularly, if you think your medications are not working, you can ask for a new prescription. Take good care of yourself, eat healthy diet, have enough sleep and regular exercise. Please don’t try to harm yourself. Don’t give up, you will get better. I will be praying for you.
[S]
I usually just make sporadic eye contact - look, hold for a few seconds, look away - there’s no point in getting into staring contests. Sometimes for emphasis I’ll hold eye contact a bit longer, but I find it uncomfortable as well. I think most people do, and so it’s perfectly fine not to make eye contact in most cases. I do make eye contact with girls I find attractive. Can’t help it, I just like looking into their eyes.

With psychotic depression can a mood be so low it is like a psychosis? is suicide a major factor in psychosis? what I mean is when a person is suicidal relating to depression is that considered a psychotic episode??
[S]
I was diagnosed with psychotic episodes around the age 24 - I was also prescribed anti depressants, and i feel my diagnosis was closer to psychotic depression. My depression started in my late teens. The depression did lift but the psychotic features remained - i am still psychotic 18 years later.
[S]
No not really being suicidal isn't part of psychosis.Psychosis means you have lost touch with reality in some way,in that you might not know you are on earth or alive or conscious of your surroundings,you may be delusional and living a different reality...like you may think you are on a different planet and everyone around you are aliens in human form,you might not know what day or time it is and may take off and live rough for days until help finds you.Psychotic depression can include very low mood and suicidal feelings though but it isn't usually a major factor in psychosis.Does that help and make sense?
[S]
ok best i can advise is i suffer from Psychosis and major depression at a very low time can have the same affects in some cases if you so low yes u can totaly lose reality and become a prisoner with in yourself but also this can happen but you seem to carry on as normal with day to day life but this major depressive feeling is deep with in yourself which is a worry as everybody around u sees u as normal this mental injury doesent have plasters or a bandage to show you are ill or hurt ive suffered so long i mask it well my family cant tell my state of mind 80% of the time which is bad you need to open up as much as possible and try not to totaly hide it so this way you dont become a prisoner with in your own mind/body i have a 5yr post on this site all the good and bad and still running today may be worth a read i hope u manage to fine the piece with in yourself and find your way to cope with this all the best mark


[P]
Life is sometimes too much to bear....money worries, stress and depression make it even harder. But how do you cope when everything you do in life just seems so pointless? Never really feeling suicidal, but not really wanting to be here either? How to deal with feeling like you are living a lie, playing a game, acting a play, keeping up the charade that everything is fine and normal and finding very little joy in anything? Feeling disconnected and alone with your thoughts and everything seems surreal. A bystander watching life pass by, but not feeling it? Afraid to share these thoughts and feelings with family and loved ones for fear of showing weakness or even unraveling completely just by admitting it out loud? Welcome to my life.
[S]
I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one

I'm sorry you're feeling so terrible Imhotep That's such a hard place to be, when you're having suicidal thoughts, and everything seems hopeless. It's not lame at all to write about this here. Many people will relate to the place you find yourself in, many of us have been there too. I hope expressing here how you feel, and reaching out to others who might understand, will help a little. I'm glad you've posted what you did, it's better than keeping it to yourself, and struggling alone. If you feel in danger of acting on your suicidal thoughts please have a look at our page on getting help. It tells you who to contact if you need emergency medical help, plus other sources of support if you feel in crisis. There is also this article by one of our staff members on feeling suicidal that may be helpful to read. I hope things improve for you Imhotep. Do you have any support at the moment, anyone you can talk to? Please don't feel you have failed, you are at a really difficult time in your life, but that doesn't mean you are a failure. Try not to compare yourself to others, in my experience it has only made me feel worse about myself. And it's not comparing like with like. You are trying (and have tried hard in the past with different approaches) to find a way out, a way for things to feel better. I know it's hard, but please keep trying. Something will help, if you can find the right thing for you. I hope your anxiety lessens enough to let you get some sleep. Take care.

[P]
To start this, I'll be blunt and say I'm not even sure that I'm posting in the right place. Regardless, I hope you all can help me. To some of you this may be offensive. How do I know? If I’m a bad person, that is. Am I? My mind says no, but my heart says yes. Emotionally, I’m a harsh human being of almost zealous callousness. I can’t understand why. Why do I feel like I NEED to be callous? It’s even more stupid because I am so desperate for love. I feel alone. Is it a cycle that feeds itself? Do I sink further and further? I can’t even tell anymore. Let me give some examples, to state exactly what kind of person I am… -Whenever I hear of a mass shooting or bombing (or otherwise terrorist action, killing spree, etc.) I think about how it could be done better. -My last real girlfriend (non-distant relationship) broke up with me because I was “too psychologically unstable”. Her reason for saying this was that I threatened a guy who was hitting on her. (I am a 280 pound behemoth of a person- I’ve been told I look like an NFL lineman.) I told him I’d put him in the hospital. -I get angry at the DUMBEST things. People going one mile below the speed limit, old people in Walmart, you get the point. Dumb stuff. I legit get angry. -This is an oddball one. I once saw a stinkbug drowning in a cup of water, and moved by emotion, freed it from its captivity so it could live. Yet when I see someone break a bone or twist an ankle, I won’t move to help them. In many ways I abhor them for wasting my time. -I rarely smile. When I do it’s a dumb “I can’t control my smile” kind of smile. I hate it. I’ve gained some not good weight (college is a bitch) and hate how my smile looks now. Regardless, my common face is noted to be angry. -I can’t let go of grudges. A guy I knew in 4th grade ran into me the other day. I was a pretty emotional kid in elementary school and middle school, and it was easy to make me cry. This guy- he stole my pencil in 4th grade. I didn’t care about it, it wasn’t special. I legit cried when he stole it though. He tried to act friendly with me. I told him I hated him and he’d be doing society a favor by dying. -I want to join the armed forces just for comradery. Better than being alone. I figure if I die, I might do the world a favor anyway. -I measure people as a resource, ranging from valuable metals to literally more expendable than dirt. I consider myself dirt, the status quo of humanity. Perfectly expendable and easily replaceable. -I’m an atheist by default, not by choice. I feel like I’m “too smart” to believe in God. I know the bible wasn’t officially made canon until roughly 325 or something like that, and the Jewish version of god can’t exist if he allowed his people to nearly be exterminated in the Holocaust, right? I know this is an insult to religious individuals, and I’m sorry. I wish I could choose to ignore reality and place my faith into something I can’t see, but I literally can’t do it. This is it’s own set of issues, leading me to have NO spiritual balance. -I’m stubborn BEYOND comparison. I have lost friends over the STUPIDEST things. Just because I can’t NOT argue with them if we differ in opinion. I constantly feel like I will lose my best friends because their opinions differ from mine. -I hate drugs. What a fucking waste. Why the HELL do people take drugs? Ever? Also I do mean ILLEGAL ones. Weed… sorta counts. To me it does. I have nearly lost a friend to weed, and he wasted a lot of potential he has. -I make small lies consistently until I believe them. This is weird, I know. Sometimes my past is too blurred with lies and reality for me to remember what ACTUALLY happened. Everything I am saying here is the truth, but know that I lie all the time in person. Usually it’s just to be funny or talk about my ridiculous friends, the few I have. -I am a virgin. I’m 20. I feel isolated for that alone. For someone who doesn’t believe in eternal damnation or heaven (not really, at least…) I have a surprisingly strict moral code. I just can’t have sex with people if I don’t feel like it will be eternal. This is also a factor in my only two actual relationships ending. -I’m awkward. I stutter all the time and get anxious easily. Working retail has helped a bit, but it still happens quite often. I hope this has done some work to help you understand what kind of person I am. Yet all I feel like is a coward, a liar, a monster, and a criminal. I haven’t even committed any crimes, I just feel like I will one day. I feel ugly and unloved, more than that unlovable. I want help, and going to counseling hasn’t helped me. Is it a lack of maturity? Maybe self-hatred created from nothing? I should mention now that I have always been loved by my parents, but I feel like a disappointment. My brother is great at everything, and I’m useless. They always tell me that’s all in my head, and it’s true. Yet I can’t help but feel I am just a great big disappointment. Additionally, I was VERY depressed for about 6 or 7 years, starting with the death of my cat (my first memories are of her, and I love animals). A year or so later a friend shot himself (ruled an accident, but I know better. His parents believe that God had greater things in mind for him. I hope they die, I hate them more than anything in this world.) and ultimately I felt no difference. He was my friend, not even a good one. A friend nonetheless. At 14, it seemed so unreal to most. My commentary was more like “this kind of thing happens.” Please. Help me. I fear that at this rate, I will become suicidal (again), homicidal, and worst of all… that I will never be able to get a lasting relationship. I feel so unloved. I don’t feel like I deserve it. So please, help me. I need advice, even opinions. Anything will do.

I’d also look into why exactly this is causing you stress... being asked to sit with workmates, teambuilding lunches, it doesn’t sound like it should be causing stress. Similarly it’s kind of normal to be open to a certain extent when with others. So if this is causing you stress, perhaps there is some other underlying cause? What Poopy Doll said about the forces is also probably right, that the kind of attitudes towards “building character” there are even more old school then at other institutions. It’s worth thinking about what you are letting yourself in for...

im currently dealing with a lot of mental illnesses and I dont know how much more of it I can bare. Im currently diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Major Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Psychosis, Paranoia, Aspergers and lastly Sensory Interegation Disorder. I know its alot and you probably dont believe me but its true and I want someone to actually listen to me and not push me away because thats what people do to me... I dont have friends because of my Aspergers, Schizophrenia and paranoia; my "friends" will literally walk away faster than me put their headphones in and walk away so they cant hear me. Or tell all 5 of us in the group to go to a teachers classroom and hang out but only say "lets all 4 of us go to this teacher " when he knows there are 5 in the group.. I cant even meet new people because I cant look at people in their eyes when I talk or talk on the phone with them cause im completly scared out of my mind that they are making fun of me and are trying to hurt me but they are not and I know that but the voices inside tell me they are. Ive been on so much medicine and been to so many therapist appointments and psychiatrist appoints, but still cant help believe these delusions. To this day everyday Im depressed and have so many anxiety attacks and so much depersonalization i get scared so I cant help but self harm parts of my body i dislike and self harm in visible places so maybe people will help instead of pushing me away. I feel numb inside to a point I wanna kill myself and have attempted twice and still dont have a tear to shed no matter how hard I try to cry. I cant even eat food anymore because I constantly have an image and thoughts in my head of someone throwing up or nasty stuff in general

I can kinda understand what u describe. Growing up I always seemed to have a 'strange' sense of humour. for example Id see a film where someone is getting killed by being run over by a car and lose their legs and find it funny while others found it grotesque. One of the best ones I heard was 'I knew XXX was gay cos hes always so 'nice''. Or 'I hate how all the lads tease XXX just because hes so perfect'. Im far from perfect. Theres nothing wrong with being selfish... just dont hurt others in the process
[S]
I hate eye contact but know it is expected, especially if you're asking for help. I look disgusting and want to avoid seeing the judgement in other peoples eyes. One thing that kinda worked was wearing some clear lens glasses instead of my proper ones. I am short sighted and thus those clear lens ones give me the comfort of the psychological barrier betwixt me and them AND since I cant make out their facial expressions I don't notice any urrrghhh reaction to me.

I was hoping that those of you that have been dx'ed with psychotic depression at one point or another) could share a few answers with me (if possible). Here they are: At what age were you dx'ed with psychotic depression? Did the psychosis start at the exact time as the depressive state? (If not which started 1st)? Once the depressive state was resolved did the psychotic features remain? Was there ever a time that you felt well enough that your doctor allowed you to wean off of your meds? If so, how long did the weaning process take? Did you ever relaspe?
[S]
I was diagnosed with psychotic episodes around the age 24 - I was also prescribed anti depressants, and i feel my diagnosis was closer to psychotic depression. My depression started in my late teens. The depression did lift but the psychotic features remained - i am still psychotic 18 years later.
[S]
ok best i can advise is i suffer from Psychosis and major depression at a very low time can have the same affects in some cases if you so low yes u can totaly lose reality and become a prisoner with in yourself but also this can happen but you seem to carry on as normal with day to day life but this major depressive feeling is deep with in yourself which is a worry as everybody around u sees u as normal this mental injury doesent have plasters or a bandage to show you are ill or hurt ive suffered so long i mask it well my family cant tell my state of mind 80% of the time which is bad you need to open up as much as possible and try not to totaly hide it so this way you dont become a prisoner with in your own mind/body i have a 5yr post on this site all the good and bad and still running today may be worth a read i hope u manage to fine the piece with in yourself and find your way to cope with this all the best mark

Your "fast" episode sounds a lot like classic mania. Everything is driven, sped up, bouncing wildly from one thing to another. Brilliant ideas that you realize later didn't even make sense. Not sleeping. With my Bipolar II diagnosis I don't experience mania quite to the extreme that you're describing - no psychosis etc., only on the lows - and it's called "hypomania." But even with that, I'm all too familiar with that sickening crash. It seems like at a certain point in a manic episode, your mind and body just plain run out of energy. No one can sustain that accelerated pace forever. For me actually it has never lasted longer than two weeks. And then you find yourself teetering on the edge. The smallest thing can trigger it, and before you know it, so rapidly that someone watching you could probably see it happen - you fall out of the sky. I have just recently pulled out of a very long and deep depressive episode that was triggered by my diagnosis and exacerbated by the mood stabilizer they put me on. The dosage, as it turns out, was too high; not only was it knocking off the highs, but it was flattening my mood at a level far below where it should have been. A simple change in dose of the same mood stabilizer, plus a different antidepressant, and I truly feel like a new person. Sadly, like your team told you, it just does take time. Different people respond in different ways to various medications and therapies, and it takes time just to see if a medication is working before trying something else. Most antidepressants, for example, won't take effect until about a month after starting them. In dealing with the fallout from your manic episode, knowledge is power. You can't change what you did, but you can learn and understand why you did it - why your mind was out of control. Strained and broken relationships are the most painful thing, and sometimes they never can be repaired. But as I'm learning, it's so important that you forgive yourself and move on from there. To keep wallowing in mortified guilt isn't going to get you anywhere. It just makes your offense look bigger and bigger in hindsight. Anyway I'm wishing you the best in all this. It's a tough road for sure, and things may get worse before they get better (I hope not!) but they will get better.


[P]
I just want to die peacefully: I know I'll have to tiptoe around due to forum guidelines. I just want to go. My future looks bleak. I live in poverty, I have food but I cant afford my favorite drink. Soda. I'll continue to live in poverty. My benefits case has been open over 2 years now. My attorney says it may be another 2 years, possibly longer. I did some research the other day about substances that could be harmful. I checked into what I thought to be the most dangerous substance I can get my hands on. I found a pro suicide website that had an alphabetized list of dangerous substances as well as the quantity necessary to cause harm. I found out that there's another substance that I have that's even more harmful and in smaller quantities. Oddly enough there's a fairly common MH substance that requires over a thousand to be harmful. How in the hell could someone get a hold of that much of a substance? Then I looked into another section that listed levels of pain caused be certain actions and the length of time those actions would take to achieve a certain result. I still don't know if it was morbid curiousity or intention that drew me in. Today I'm thinking that I'm glad that I have the information. I'm thinking of harming myself. I just want the pain to go away. Maybe I'll get lucky and after you die there's just nothing. Nothing forever and ever and ever. This thought comforts me. I don't like the idea of a frozen hell or a burning hell. I have this mental image of a hell where everything is as twisted as my mind. Demons feasting upon the weak. Murders, torment, and torture. I have an image of hell being much like the earth, but in a post apocalyptic world. A ruined earth. In this place its everyone for themselves because every resident is just as sick and demented as you are. I think if there is a hell that's where I would want to be. Have you ever seen the movie Constantine? When he goes to hell that's a lot like my vision of hell. There would be a lot of bold colors there. Lots of black, crimson, and rust tones. Lots of darkness and eyes peering at you from the sewers and from under rocks. The shadow people I'm sure would be there. No longer in hiding. I could finally be able to challenge them face to face. Even a burning hell would be better than the insanity I suffer in my brain. I just want it to stop. Forever.
[S]
Definitely be around people who will support and help you - that's a must. Problem is, for many of us, we don't even know what the issues are, or what the hell is going on, and why things go wrong, for many, many years, even our whole lives in some cases. I'm pushing 50, and have only just been diagnosed. There are those who will quite happily use your weaknesses against you - and you don't even know they are doing it at the time. It's later. A lifetime later in some cases. Well, fuck that
[S]
Some schools of thought believe in negative reinforcement. Some people keep a rubber band around their wrist and snap themselves when they say a swear word, have the urge to use a substance, think of binge eating, etc. So long as its only as obtrusive as a snap from a rubberband I don't see it as harmful, but if you need a bandage after then that is harmful.
[S]
I read every word. First off, there is no problem in this world that can't be made worse by drinking or other substance abuse. You must address that first. There are tons of help available and I know of a wonderful forum for sobriety that if you pm me, I will send that to you. Second, stop and think for a minute about your willingness to take illegitimate substances but stubbornly refuse a prescription which can authentically help you. It's true it may take a few weeks to kick in, but if you don't give it a start will you not be in the same or worse circumstances at the end of those few weeks? Bravo for leaving the terribly abusive Ex, that is horrid business and takes a lot of time and work to heal from. I have, to my dismay, been down that path. It is so confusing at the time. So damaging. Just about everywhere has free domestic violence counseling. Please give them a call asap. You are in dire trouble on several fronts and I am so glad you are reaching out for help and support. I hope you will make some positive decisions and pivotal changes in your life. There is a huge support community to help you through all it.

I have been self harming since Wednesday night. I self harmed. I wanted to do feel it again Thursday morning so I self harmed again and yesterday and today. I think I am now addicted. How am I gona stop??! Obiously I am struggling so much that is why I am self harming
[S]
It sounds to me that you are doing as much as you can to support your daughter. She will need to build up trust with you little by little. Asking for help when you Self harm is a frightening thing. There is such a stigma around it. She also may feel that she doesn't want to burden you, that she has failed you in some way, that she is unworthy of help and support. Self harm is a way of release, of stress, of mental pain that she is feeling. I can completely understand that this bullying is the trigger for it. Its such a cruel world we live in and kids can be the cruellest picking on the vulnerable ones amongst them. Talking really does help so if you can get her some professional help in that area that should help her deal with the need to self harm.
[S]
I've been married for 16 years. I can tell you it doesn't get easier. Having kids makes it harder. Divorce hurts kids. I'd advise being sure everything is healthy before you tie the knot. I watch porn a lot as a coping mechanism and I hide it from my wife. Sex with her is good. Even if we're having sex regularly I still watch it. It hurts her when she finds it but I rely on it to self sooth. I know it's not healthy and I know I should build real relationships.

I got diagnosed with depression first.. At around 20.. i was well suicidal and did allot of hard core self harm... I've been on meds ever since.. 27 years of junk... They changed my diagnosis all the time when i was younger.. They almost put me on lithium at one point.. Then they thought i was schizophrenic for a while.. Basically I've been on meds my entire adult life.


[P]
Feel empty: Yesterday I tried to take my own life and ended up in hospital for most of the day, wasnt sectioned though. I feel so numb now and don't know what to do
[S]
To try answer your questions, unsure why the police would be involved but if they were and had concerns for your safety they may ask for a mh assessment. It would depend on circumstances whether you would be sectioned. It isn't a crime to (try to) take your life, again would depend on what had happened, circumstances, as to whether police would interview. Sounds as though you are ready to /need to ask for help if you are thinking about suicide and also about surviving an attempt. You can go to A+E and ask for assessment or call crisis team number to talk to them? I understand feeling desperate and suicidal, am there myself. But think there is hope for you if you are thinking about what if you survive, you can seek help, hope you do x
[S]
the thing with neighbor problems especially if there are lots of other neighbors close by, they really cant be sure. i mean the folk opposite could have complained. i have been in a situation where i complained about a neighbour who was a hazard to themselves and others. and the person did actually say to me it was you wasnt it and i denied it. as i had nothing to loose and they would never be sure. like you i couldnt cope with the situation and needed to bring it to an end as no one else who lived in the neighborhood was going to do it. and really they need to be careful as if they are doing drugs they need to keep a fairly low profile and any possibilty of keeping their little boy is at stake. so the odds are stacked against them. maybe might be a good idea to report them for drug use to the police while you are about it. as then the police can keep an eye on it. and maybe take action in the future again you can remain anonymous

When I was arrested by the Counter Terrorism Police in 2010, I was sectioned. I made it clear I would have a proper pop at them and the NHS in court. One of the officers said he was keen to see me 'get the help and support' I needed. He, for his own part, probably meant it. I was sectioned, and left to the dirty twats in the NHS. I have tried long and hard to resolve this matter. But so far, I have only spoken to the Police and the NHS themselves about the matter. Sometimes nicely. Sometimes not so nicely. It was recently said: 'have you ever known the coppers not to respond to someone so distressed....' I made two 999 calls, and the Police threatened me saying: 'Don't call again. Or we'll come and see you'. Wow. Just fucking Wow. Talking to the Police and the NHS about this now is a fat, useless, waste of time. But there is such a thing as charitable and unbiased victim support. And there are such a thing as journalists and lawyers The Police and the NHS officials who have been involved in my case, need to know that no matter how much shit they throw in my direction, and no matter how black a picture their stitch-up ambush seeks to paint of me, that will reflect on them also. And much, much more than they have prepared for. They have had their chance, and now I am taking it forward, to an open court if necessary. And there's nothing they can do about it. I intend to hold the professionals as accountable as possible, and metaphorically rip their fucking heads off and their hearts out, and lay them to waste on their own turf I am going to make them known, and put an end to them.

first post so a bit new to all this. I'm in a residual rehab at this moment for both drugs and help with Bi Polar II. iv been steady for a while now thanks to taking my meds prober. but I am getting the odd days off manic depression and find it very hard to express the way I am feeling or even identify what's going on. I write a lot and this helps, using images to try and describe what is going on. I feel if I was to just rant it would come out as a "I hate the world, they way we are organised and the human race" rant but want to understand the core off this hate. the closest I think I can get to it is I feel like all my insides have been sucked out and replaced with a thick fog. or like iv been plugged in to something that's taking control of my soul.... self harming brings me back into this world for a while and gives me a rush, to that I find very addicting. I had gone about 2 months without self harming but relapsed early last week . and have gone from a Huge dip to Manic . what is also worrying me is I am starting to have thoughts off self harm even in manic phases. I will share more of my story in other posts . don't really know what I'm asking tbh but even the act of writing this down has helped.

Your "fast" episode sounds a lot like classic mania. Everything is driven, sped up, bouncing wildly from one thing to another. Brilliant ideas that you realize later didn't even make sense. Not sleeping. With my Bipolar II diagnosis I don't experience mania quite to the extreme that you're describing - no psychosis etc., only on the lows - and it's called "hypomania." But even with that, I'm all too familiar with that sickening crash. It seems like at a certain point in a manic episode, your mind and body just plain run out of energy. No one can sustain that accelerated pace forever. For me actually it has never lasted longer than two weeks. And then you find yourself teetering on the edge. The smallest thing can trigger it, and before you know it, so rapidly that someone watching you could probably see it happen - you fall out of the sky.

Here a couple of things I'd say to offer some support (although I am by no means a licensed professional): 1. Structure - You noted to us that whenever you're alone, your anxiety and depression get the best of you. I'm the same way (minus the depression), because my OCD makes me obsess a lot over little things. In general, I would recommend structure. Get out more often, find things to fill your time with—that are healthy—and do your best to lead a productive life. 2. Finding a Job - Finding a job sounds like it will be essential to your recovery path. What I would recommend is asking your clinical supports (e.g counselor) if there are any rehab programs that help mentally ill people find employment. In my state of Massachusetts, we have an organization called MRC that does just that. My hope is that those options will be made available to you. However, I would also say to take it easy. While money is a present problem for you, putting too much pressure on yourself over finding a job while you're already on a bumpy road will exacerbate your symptoms. You want to ensure you're stable going into a job. 3. Coping Skills - Coping skills are also imperative to your overall mental health. Everyone needs them. When you have moments of self-doubt, ask yourself some questions: "What makes this not my fault?" "What can I do to help myself?" Something else that will help is giving yourself self-soothing. Coloring, writing, drawing, listening to music, meditation, and exercise are all healthy examples of coping mechanisms that are recommended by clinical professionals. They keep us feeling strong and help us keep our minds in the right place. 4. Give Yourself a Break - You're not to blame for everything. It really is unfortunate that you've lost so many people, and I'm very sorry that all of these difficulties are piling up on your shoulders, but there is a lot of hope still in store for you. You have to be easy on yourself, and recognize that we're only human. Pace your recovery and make sure your counselor is aware of how you feel. If you need any further encouragement or support, let me know!
[S]
I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one

Parenting a teen help advice: My daughter (15) has been self harming and we only found out about 3 weeks ago so we are new to this journey. My daughter is now seeing a psychologist, which she hates doing. She still tells us that what she is doing is fine because it works and there is nothing wrong with it. As her parents, we are now scared to discipline her for anything for fear that it might make the situation worse. Or that she will withdraw from us even more. Does anyone have experience with this or any advice on discipline? She has started shifting the friends that she hangs out with at school. She seems drawn to the more rebellious group of children. We hate to see her get more involved in unhealthy behaviours but we feel powerless to prevent it.
[S]
So sorry, this is very hard for parents. We love our children unconditionally and deeply...and it hurts us to see them hurt themselves. It is good that she is seeing a psychologist. Perhaps you and your husband want to consider seeing a therapist together to talk about how to handle the specific issues that are coming up. You still want to parent your child and that may require discipline to continue to form her into a responsible adult. It might help to get support in the best approach to doing this. There may also be parent support groups for parents dealing with these issues. She is only fifteen, it is understandable that you are concerned about who she is socializing with. Kids at this age can be very persuaded and influenced. You and your husband need support right now. This may also lead to family counseling where the three of you can openly discuss issues and perhaps understand the needs of each other. You are the parents, it is wise not to ignore the signs that something is not right or that your daughter might be making poor choices. If you belong to a church, perhaps you can speak to the pastor. You love her and want the best for her. Children at 15 are not able to know what is best. I hope you can find the resources you need to get through this. Stay strong!

I cared for my grandmother for a number of years till she passed, but I always promised her that she wouldn't be sent away, as she was terrified of hospital and....my mother (her daughter). I took on her care, after I found that my mother had taken my nans dog to be put down as she (my mother) didn't like cleaning up after it.... not that my mother saw her much. My Nan cared for me as a child and was the buffer between me and my mother (along with my granddad). She was a lovely woman, who towards the end, constantly asked what day it was, tipped her plate of food down the back of the kitchen radiator, and insisted that my father had stolen my grandfathers work tools. Never aggressive, often bewildered, but always grateful if you sat and held her hand. I miss her also
[S]
You have been in this position a long time and it will feel shocking to you to be assertive with her. She is being very selfish. Your school work is work enough. When she is verbally abusive to you, you are old enough now to stop pleasing her and tell her instead that you do not deserve to be treated that way. And walk out of the house after you tell her that you do not deserve to be treated that way. Do not do the chores if she verbally abuses you. If you treat me that way, I won't help you at all. You can stand up to her. You are not her little girl anymore. Doing this will feel foreign to you. But she is being very bossy and unkind to a perfect daughter. I tried to get my mother's understanding and approval for years before I realized I wasn't going to get it.

Recently I've become even more suicidal than I had previously been and am seriously considering taking my own life. My friends know of this, the NHS knows of this and they're doing nothing to help. Anyway, if it were to result in a failed suicide attempt what would happen if the police were involved? Would you be sectioned immediately or taken in for questioning?

Parent Seeking Advice: I recently found out that my daughter has been self-harming. We had a long and really open discussion about it in a non-confrontational way and she even proffered her tools which I hadn't intended to take off her. She said she hadn't harmed for quite a long time before this incident which was brought about by her first excursion into the town near her school to meet with friends and resulted in her being beaten up by a girl in the year above her at school who had been drinking alcohol all afternoon. I took my daughter to the Doctor to try and get a referral to CAMHS and arranged with work to be able to work one day a week from home so i could be around more, and had her signed off school for the last week. I have asked her if she wants to go back to school and she has said no - so I plan to let her be home-schooled from September. My concern is that having removed her from the people I believed had been causing her distress/abuse/bullying etc I now find it hard to understand why the desire to self harm is still happening as this was her first incident in a while (unless she wasn't truthful about this being the first instance). I've suggested she join a discussion forum so that if she feels the need to self-harm she could seek the support of others to help her but she is not very receptive to this idea or to the list of suggested alternatives that I found on the internet as ideas from people who had self harmed in the past and what they found useful. Despite me being open and non judgmental with her she still finds it difficult to talk to me when she has self harmed but will discuss it with her sisters (which is something). Just would really like to know what I should be doing to help her and feeling somewhat helpless instead.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

You are a young adult and need your own space, especially with going to med school. You might need to sit down with mom and have a heart to heart talk with her. Explain how difficult med school is and the amount of work required to be successful. She might also need to come to realize that all work and no play is a formula for failure. Remember it is her house and she is doubling as a landlord. It is a difficult situation for both of you.Perhaps you can agree on some things you can do around the house that would be acceptable to both of you. Be firm , loving and prepared when you approach her. Be sure to choose a good time for both of you where you are both relaxed and open to the conversation.

I need help resisting the urge to self harm: About a month ago someone leaked nude pictures of me without my consent. The pictures included my name, face, and personal info. I was threatened that the photos would be sent to friends and family by the poster. I have been harassed and tormented online. I cry myself to sleep every night and I self harm almost everyday. I have constant thoughts of suicide. I have anxiety and paranoia about the photos being reposted or sent to my parents. I google my name every thirty minutes. The sound of notifications startle me, I'm afraid that it is someone telling me they found my pictures. The anxiety has also affected everyday things. I will check if I brought my keys with me every hour that I am not home and I check that I placed my books inside my backpack 10-20 times before I leave my apartment. I need to stop because its making me ill. I don't know what I can do to stop the urges. I want to stop but I don't know how.

This may not be a wise move from a legal standpoint, but I would knock it out of the air. You'd surely know who was flying it when they came to collect the wreckage. But then that might instigate a fight. I HATE drones. I read about a guy who shot one down with a shotgun because the neighbor was using it to take pictures of his young daughters in bathing suits near their pool. My brother told me about a nature show he was watching, they had a drone getting close up photos of a chimpanzee or other ape. The ape getting pissed off at it casually picked up a stick and knocked it out of the air smashing it to pieces. I feel the same way about drones as the ape did.
[S]
I have all the evidence but I feel like the poster won't be punished and will run free and continue to do worse, like send the photos to my parents. I feel like the police cannot help me remove all the links that come up on google when my name is searched.

You could potentially have traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, it was one of the things I thought of when reading that, but you also shouldn't rule out things like Asperger Syndrome as I know one of the traits of that can be wanting to be alone a lot. Speak to your GP and lay your soul bare about what your problems are, it's really the only way to get going on the road to recovery, whatever the diagnosis may or may not be.  Your story about the fires was incredible. We've not had such a fire here. But we did have a Hurricane recently. We did not get a direct hit. We stayed home with supplies for a week. I actually like the winds thrashing the vegetation about and we could hear and see this out our back glass door. We only boarded up the bedroom windows for a Safe Room. The electricity went off. We cracked open some windows to keep the roof from popping off. After the storm it was a steamy 90 degrees with 98 percent humidity. It was literally so hot you couldn't stop sweating and I became hysterical in the heat. All the neighbors came outside and were milling about, talking, sharing stories about how their generators did or did not start up. A neighbor told me that the nearby motel had it's electric and she said she was going to go get a room there. An air conditioned room. She convinced me to go there too. So I stayed at the motel for one night and then we were extremely lucky that our neighborhood's electric came back on the next day. Being that sick in the heat can kill you. 14 elderly people died in a Residence for the Elderly from the heat in another area about twenty minutes away. That was a terrible situation of neglect because the staff kept those old folks in the unairconditioned building and they knew darn well it was making them all sick. Right across the street was a Hospital where they all should have been taken. Some nurses from the hospital went over to the old folks place to check on them and found many elderly unresponsive. Evacuation of the building followed. Right after the storm the government said they'd make a new law requiring every elderly facility to have generators to run the AC. But after a few weeks, the story died down and the new law was forgotten.

Is physical self-punishment bad? I've heard of people giving themselves rewards for being able to do things they have trouble doing, and I've also heard of people (adults) punishing themselves when they do something they believe is wrong, either by depriving themselves of a treat (dessert, TV, etc.), or, in rare cases, by physically hurting (but not necessarily harming) themselves. Is punishing yourself, particularly by causing yourself (harmless) pain, wrong or unhealthy? I know this may be subjective, but I just wanted to hear other people's thoughts on it.
[S]
That does make more sense. But can a person be in such a low mood they kind of lose touch perhaps not with reality but with themselves??

When I was arrested by the Counter Terrorism Police in 2010, I was sectioned. I made it clear I would have a proper pop at them and the NHS in court. One of the officers said he was keen to see me 'get the help and support' I needed. He, for his own part, probably meant it. I was sectioned, and left to the dirty twats in the NHS. I have tried long and hard to resolve this matter. But so far, I have only spoken to the Police and the NHS themselves about the matter. Sometimes nicely. Sometimes not so nicely. It was recently said: 'have you ever known the coppers not to respond to someone so distressed....' I made two 999 calls, and the Police threatened me saying: 'Don't call again. Or we'll come and see you'. Wow. Just fucking Wow. Talking to the Police and the NHS about this now is a fat, useless, waste of time. But there is such a thing as charitable and unbiased victim support. And there are such a thing as journalists and lawyers The Police and the NHS officials who have been involved in my case, need to know that no matter how much shit they throw in my direction, and no matter how black a picture their stitch-up ambush seeks to paint of me, that will reflect on them also. And much, much more than they have prepared for. They have had their chance, and now I am taking it forward, to an open court if necessary. And there's nothing they can do about it. I intend to hold the professionals as accountable as possible, and metaphorically rip their fucking heads off and their hearts out, and lay them to waste on their own turf I am going to make them known, and put an end to them.

the thing with neighbor problems especially if there are lots of other neighbors close by, they really cant be sure. i mean the folk opposite could have complained. i have been in a situation where i complained about a neighbour who was a hazard to themselves and others. and the person did actually say to me it was you wasnt it and i denied it. as i had nothing to loose and they would never be sure. like you i couldnt cope with the situation and needed to bring it to an end as no one else who lived in the neighborhood was going to do it. and really they need to be careful as if they are doing drugs they need to keep a fairly low profile and any possibilty of keeping their little boy is at stake. so the odds are stacked against them. maybe might be a good idea to report them for drug use to the police while you are about it. as then the police can keep an eye on it. and maybe take action in the future again you can remain anonymous


[P]
Unable to stop doing things which can get you in trouble. Does anyone exhibit stalker behavior when a significant loved one, family member, or friend ceases to talk to you? The person exhibiting the behavior knows it is wrong and dangerous but they do it anyways. Partly because of the excitement it generates coupled with moments of seeing the individual are to great to pass up.
[S]
I’m sorry you are feeling like you are worthless and I know – I’ve been there. The reality is you are worth so very much and I hope you can begin to see this. You are uniquely gifted and you have a story to tell and a part to play in your own life and in others’. Many people in your position are not sensitive to how their problems affect others. You care about your husband’s reactions to your situation and that is a hopeful sign – you have not withdrawn into yourself. You are aware of how you feel; ask yourself how this is impacting your behavior, and also what you are doing to change your situation. You need action here. Have you talked to your family doctor? You have a psychiatrist – do you consider them an effective help? If not, try someone else but keep persevering. Have you tried simply a counselor? If you’re on medication, do you stay on track with it? These are all positive things you can do to help yourself. Once you feel you’re moving forward, talk this over with your husband. He loves you and I’m sure is concerned and would be encouraged.

I would complain to the Council. For your own mental health. What she is doing totally disrespects her neighbors. Don't worry about protecting her. You may be doing her a favor. Bad behavior does not deserve to be rewarded.

I don't honestly know much about masochism nor how it relates to self harming, or develops from self harming. I know that when a tendency in me arose towards bulimia behavior, I said to myself, "Oh hell no, not another fucking craziness. I have enough craziness with the bipolar. I'm NOT doing bulimia too. No way." And I stopped doing it. So if there isn't a childhood trauma to identify (how could you have PTSD without a trauma ??) it boils down to: Do you want to keep this urge as your little secret or Do you want to nip it in the bud ??

cant stop buying things: I have a problem where I buy things all the time, I posted this on the depression forum but my post did'nt appear. I buy mostly from charity shops and have far too many clothes and shoes, this is a big problem for me as we have had to take out a loan. I want to save and go on holiday next year but am worried I will whittle money away. Does anyone else relate to this?
[S]
I also have a problem with spending. I buy too many clothes, craft supplies, food. Sometimes it's fun, there's a bit of a high that I get when I buy something that's not a pure necessity, but then I feel anxious again about having spent so much money. There are 2 places where I shop that have a rewards program, and I always get promotions in emails for points on food and various other items, some of which are necessities, and others, not so much. I'm going to have to reign in my spending now, because I am jobless and back in university for another year.

I'm sorry you're feeling so terrible Imhotep That's such a hard place to be, when you're having suicidal thoughts, and everything seems hopeless. It's not lame at all to write about this here. Many people will relate to the place you find yourself in, many of us have been there too. I hope expressing here how you feel, and reaching out to others who might understand, will help a little. I'm glad you've posted what you did, it's better than keeping it to yourself, and struggling alone. If you feel in danger of acting on your suicidal thoughts please have a look at our page on getting help. It tells you who to contact if you need emergency medical help, plus other sources of support if you feel in crisis. There is also this article by one of our staff members on feeling suicidal that may be helpful to read. I hope things improve for you Imhotep. Do you have any support at the moment, anyone you can talk to? Please don't feel you have failed, you are at a really difficult time in your life, but that doesn't mean you are a failure. Try not to compare yourself to others, in my experience it has only made me feel worse about myself. And it's not comparing like with like. You are trying (and have tried hard in the past with different approaches) to find a way out, a way for things to feel better. I know it's hard, but please keep trying. Something will help, if you can find the right thing for you. I hope your anxiety lessens enough to let you get some sleep. Take care.

Here a couple of things I'd say to offer some support (although I am by no means a licensed professional): 1. Structure - You noted to us that whenever you're alone, your anxiety and depression get the best of you. I'm the same way (minus the depression), because my OCD makes me obsess a lot over little things. In general, I would recommend structure. Get out more often, find things to fill your time with—that are healthy—and do your best to lead a productive life. 2. Finding a Job - Finding a job sounds like it will be essential to your recovery path. What I would recommend is asking your clinical supports (e.g counselor) if there are any rehab programs that help mentally ill people find employment. In my state of Massachusetts, we have an organization called MRC that does just that. My hope is that those options will be made available to you. However, I would also say to take it easy. While money is a present problem for you, putting too much pressure on yourself over finding a job while you're already on a bumpy road will exacerbate your symptoms. You want to ensure you're stable going into a job. 3. Coping Skills - Coping skills are also imperative to your overall mental health. Everyone needs them. When you have moments of self-doubt, ask yourself some questions: "What makes this not my fault?" "What can I do to help myself?" Something else that will help is giving yourself self-soothing. Coloring, writing, drawing, listening to music, meditation, and exercise are all healthy examples of coping mechanisms that are recommended by clinical professionals. They keep us feeling strong and help us keep our minds in the right place. 4. Give Yourself a Break - You're not to blame for everything. It really is unfortunate that you've lost so many people, and I'm very sorry that all of these difficulties are piling up on your shoulders, but there is a lot of hope still in store for you. You have to be easy on yourself, and recognize that we're only human. Pace your recovery and make sure your counselor is aware of how you feel. If you need any further encouragement or support, let me know!

Going out alone: I suffer from Social Anxiety and going out on my own is really difficult. I can go to certain familiar places on my own, at the time of day when I know it's not going to be busy, but if I need to go somewhere unfamiliar or even somewhere familiar but during a busy time I need someone with me. How can I overcome this fear? Has anyone here experienced the same problem and how did you overcome it?
[S]
I can relate rather well to this because me and my brother are pretty similar. I do not think you specified the root to your anxiety but Anyway assuming we're on the same page one thing you can possibly change is your perspective on things, try remember that your situation is their situation, in other words do you care/judge others when you go out? no and some people that you see are probably somewhat socially awkward themselves. Remember other people aren't out there to judge you they're busy doing their own thing. Relax and have fun.

Having an episode of "going fast" turn into depression is so shocking. I have the bipolar and what has happened to you sounds familiar to me. I'm always telling people to analyze their childhood and make sure their depression isn't coming from the past. But sometimes, I think the body just goes into these cycles. I just went through a period of mania/insomnia for five days myself. I am on medication; lithium 450mg and navane 2mg. I did better on 600mg lithium but it made my intestines very sick after 7 years, so we cut it down. It's frustrating for you to have to put your life/plans on HOLD because of this MH interference. I can tell you it usually doesn't last forever because the body chemistry changes. You will get better, but nobody knows WHEN.
[S]
Your "fast" episode sounds a lot like classic mania. Everything is driven, sped up, bouncing wildly from one thing to another. Brilliant ideas that you realize later didn't even make sense. Not sleeping. With my Bipolar II diagnosis I don't experience mania quite to the extreme that you're describing - no psychosis etc., only on the lows - and it's called "hypomania." But even with that, I'm all too familiar with that sickening crash. It seems like at a certain point in a manic episode, your mind and body just plain run out of energy. No one can sustain that accelerated pace forever. For me actually it has never lasted longer than two weeks. And then you find yourself teetering on the edge. The smallest thing can trigger it, and before you know it, so rapidly that someone watching you could probably see it happen - you fall out of the sky. I have just recently pulled out of a very long and deep depressive episode that was triggered by my diagnosis and exacerbated by the mood stabilizer they put me on. The dosage, as it turns out, was too high; not only was it knocking off the highs, but it was flattening my mood at a level far below where it should have been. A simple change in dose of the same mood stabilizer, plus a different antidepressant, and I truly feel like a new person. Sadly, like your team told you, it just does take time. Different people respond in different ways to various medications and therapies, and it takes time just to see if a medication is working before trying something else. Most antidepressants, for example, won't take effect until about a month after starting them. In dealing with the fallout from your manic episode, knowledge is power. You can't change what you did, but you can learn and understand why you did it - why your mind was out of control. Strained and broken relationships are the most painful thing, and sometimes they never can be repaired. But as I'm learning, it's so important that you forgive yourself and move on from there. To keep wallowing in mortified guilt isn't going to get you anywhere. It just makes your offense look bigger and bigger in hindsight. Anyway I'm wishing you the best in all this. It's a tough road for sure, and things may get worse before they get better (I hope not!) but they will get better.

Clothes question: I know people can have issues with things like elastic,labels, and tags on clothes. What about the material though ie cotton, polyester, silk etc ? The most I ever noticed it was a shirt I had to wear for football from time to time when at prep school. I have no idea what the material was other than it wasn't polyester and didn't feel like normal cotton. I used to really dislike that sports shirt. The material was itchy and horrible against my skin . I never used to hear the other boys complaining though , and guess they had no problem with it.
[S]
I have no real idea about clothing material but i do know that i don't like big heavy jumpers.
[S]
Any jumpers irritate me a little, same with woollen hats, and scarves. When I was a kid, the feeling of having hair down my back after a haircut made me so upset I'd have to have my hair cut at home so I could instantly go into the shower, and I'd refuse to wear the shirt I got my hair cut in no matter how many times it was washed. Nowadays I'm much better about that, but it's still a bit annoying to me.
[S]
When I was a kid I once had to wear some really itchy trousers. It was horrible. We did a day trip to France that day. In the end, I think i got some pyjamas to wear underneath, but it was still itchy.

Anyone been misdiagnosed with Asperger Syndrome when they have borderline personality disorder or they been misdiagnosed with BPD when in fact they have got Aspergers/autism? Anyone actually got both conditions? I know both conditions share similar traits, such as emotional reactivity, interpersonal difficulties, impulsive issues, and problems with odd thinking.

[S]
I have lived with someone diagnosed with aspergers and someone else with BPD and I can only say those two people were entirely dissimilar and their particular problems did not 'overlap' in any way. I think you need to do more research. These two conditions are not similar at all.
[S]
I'm sorry you've been struggling, I would advise that you go to your GP as soon as possible. If the racing thoughts get too much go to A/E or contact out of hours or 111 if your in the UK. Many mental health conditions have racing thoughts. Are you sleeping? I agree the headache could be from tension/stress. Have you tried any paracetamol did it help? Hope you feel better very soon. Take care


[P]
Everyone patronises me! I have aspergers and ADHD, so it's sometimes hard for me to perform tasks other people might find easy, or even talk to other people. I also have dyscalculia, so math is incredibly hard for me to work out, which probably makes me seem dumb whenever I have to handle money or something. So yeah, I'm pretty slow in a lot of ways, but I like to think I'm still good at other things, and have a basic understanding of the world to the point that I don't need to be hand-held! Of course, all of my peers disagree, and insist on talking down to me whenever they see me, they explain things to me with that patronising, condescending voice usually reserved for an animal or a toddler, they laugh at me whenever I do something silly or clumsy, and then go 'aaw sorry, let me help you', and whenever someone says anything even remotely challenging or subtle to me, they'll be like 'hey lay off him, he doesn't understand!' Even when I achieve things, they're sometimes patronising about it. I remember once when I started dating someone, people acted with surprise, as if it was impossible that a guy with a mind like mine could ever attract someone, and then they'd either treat me with pity (thinking it wouldn't last), or refuse to believe I was really dating them. I've written a novel, and four feature-length screenplays, all of which have gotten good responses from professionals I've sent them to, but in the eyes of my peers, they're just my little hobby that won't go anywhere, and they're probably terrible anyway. I've always felt like an outsider, and this attitude really hasn't helped, I'd probably be much closer with people and have less trouble connecting with them if they'd just treat me like a damn adult.
[S]
I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one

I think I might have Autism, but I'm not sure. Can someone help me, please? I am watching a Susan Boyle interview and they're talking about how she found out that she has Asperger's Syndrome. And they talk about how she felt like she didn't fit in back in school and had emotional outbursts, and I just relate to a lot of the side effects. Obviously this doesn't mean that I have this, but I've just been wondering. I went through tests and they first said I had Schizophrenia. Then Schizoaffective Disorder. And a few times, they even said I was Bipolar. I don't know what's true and what's not. Susan Boyle also mentioned that growing up, people thought she had a learning disability. When it comes to math, I have a learning disability there. I don't know if this is a connection to Autism, so I'm not sure if I can list it as a symptom.

To keep wallowing in mortified guilt isn't going to get you anywhere. It just makes your offense look bigger and bigger in hindsight. Anyway I'm wishing you the best in all this. It's a tough road for sure, and things may get worse before they get better (I hope not!) but they will get better.

I’m alone too - a widow - and find travelling and socialising especially hard. I am learning to cope and can now travel around by train and across London without any help. I do still get nervous but have decided to keep going anyway as I can have panic attacks just in the house when I am not under any pressure. The trick in my case has been to write down every single aspect of the journey before hand. Time I need to leave the house, time of bus, time of train, carriage and seat number. VERY precise directions about each stage of the journey - get off train, turn left to ticket barrier, turn left to station exit etc. And I tick off each stage when it is managed. It is more a case of managing the fear rather than overcoming it. And it can go wrong. On my last trip the train station was having some reconstruction work done and I ended up at an exit I didn’t recognise - in the dark!!!! Happened over a week ago and I am only just recovering. The other thing that helps, if you have a mobile phone, have some support back up from an understanding friend or relative who can talk you through the situation if things do come totally unstuck.

I'm really glad you are talking about this situation you're facing. Talking about it is really helpful when you are unsure or confused. Here's what I think personally after reading your story: 1) It is absolutely okay to be unsure about some things. That's just part of being human. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise about it. 2) I would agree that you're right on track with being honest if you're unsure or not ready. Honesty upfront is usually best for everyone involved. Tell the person if you aren't sure right away and ask for their support if needed. Sometimes we all need a little extra encouragement to step into something new or outside our comfort zone. As for your mom, I obviously don't know her, but it can be hard to hear a perspective different from your own when you are sure you're right. Try to be understanding and see things from her perspective (btw, that doesn't mean you have to agree with what she says). 3) I would say it's totally okay to disagree with your parents about fundamental life issues. In fact, that's pretty normal, I think, the older we get. I've not been living with my parents almost a year now and I've disagreed with them on some major things several times. As long as it isn't something that will endanger your life or the lives of others, I think disagreeing with them is just fine. Just try to make sure you disagree with her, or anyone else, with lots of respect. 4) As far as "getting over it" goes, I think it's important to feel upset. Feeling whatever you're feeling is part of the healing process. I find it's helpful to write it all down in a journal. I write down what the person said, the situation, and how it made me feel in the moment and how it makes me feel now. Then I would say once that happens, you don't have to let their words have power over you anymore. You are strong and smart and you don't have to let negative words control your thoughts. Replace them with good, positive ones. You are unsure, and that's okay. You need time. You are growing and taking steps. There is nothing wrong with you for doing things differently. (Maybe even consider if getting a different singing teacher would be beneficial for you.) Blessings to you, dear one

Empathy - do I have it? A friend of mine says I have no empathy for other people. But I'm sure that I do. I just don't have it for babies and children (which most people seem to go absolutely ga-ga for - I hate them) When I had a girlfriend I loved her with all my heart and I wanted her to be happy (still do). I don't feel much for my mother, and I hardly grieved when my dad died. But I cry at films, (when they are happy). I get really involved in books - I feel what the hero feels. I'm sure I have empahty - it manifests in different ways. But I can't explain what those ways are
[S]
I have a relative who gets very involved with fictional characters' emotions in books, films, will go into a lot of detail re what has happened to them and why and how awful it is if they are struggling in anyway. But they struggle to recognise the feelings and situations of people around them in real life or show compassion. I don't know if being able to empathise with fictional characters/a fictional world is somehow "safer"? I think this is still a form of empathy but at a distance some how. Don't know, just my thoughts, experience. Am flooded with far too much empathy, it doesn't help anyone really and hurts a lot
[S]
i think you have empathy. although we haven't talked much on a one to one. you have helped me before and showed a lot of empathy. you probably don't remember but i do ,a few years ago i posted about abuse. and another time thinking i was a monster ,and you were really kind and supportive

Your "fast" episode sounds a lot like classic mania. Everything is driven, sped up, bouncing wildly from one thing to another. Brilliant ideas that you realize later didn't even make sense. Not sleeping. With my Bipolar II diagnosis I don't experience mania quite to the extreme that you're describing - no psychosis etc., only on the lows - and it's called "hypomania." But even with that, I'm all too familiar with that sickening crash. It seems like at a certain point in a manic episode, your mind and body just plain run out of energy. No one can sustain that accelerated pace forever. For me actually it has never lasted longer than two weeks. And then you find yourself teetering on the edge. The smallest thing can trigger it, and before you know it, so rapidly that someone watching you could probably see it happen - you fall out of the sky. I have just recently pulled out of a very long and deep depressive episode that was triggered by my diagnosis and exacerbated by the mood stabilizer they put me on. The dosage, as it turns out, was too high; not only was it knocking off the highs, but it was flattening my mood at a level far below where it should have been. A simple change in dose of the same mood stabilizer, plus a different antidepressant, and I truly feel like a new person. Sadly, like your team told you, it just does take time. Different people respond in different ways to various medications and therapies, and it takes time just to see if a medication is working before trying something else. Most antidepressants, for example, won't take effect until about a month after starting them. In dealing with the fallout from your manic episode, knowledge is power. You can't change what you did, but you can learn and understand why you did it - why your mind was out of control. Strained and broken relationships are the most painful thing, and sometimes they never can be repaired. But as I'm learning, it's so important that you forgive yourself and move on from there. To keep wallowing in mortified guilt isn't going to get you anywhere. It just makes your offense look bigger and bigger in hindsight. Anyway I'm wishing you the best in all this.

Eye contact-such a tricky one: I don't like to make eye contact but make myself do so because it's expected when you are interacting with people. I am never sure how long is too long though, and whether I'm over compensating or not. After all there's not making eye contact vs outright staring at someone. Thoughts welcomed.
[S]
I usually just make sporadic eye contact - look, hold for a few seconds, look away - there’s no point in getting into staring contests. Sometimes for emphasis I’ll hold eye contact a bit longer, but I find it uncomfortable as well. I think most people do, and so it’s perfectly fine not to make eye contact in most cases. I do make eye contact with girls I find attractive. Can’t help it, I just like looking into their eyes.
[S]
Like a lot of things in life, a balance between the two is probably best. You're right - you don't want to avoid their eye contact completely, but you also don't want to stare them down. I think it's best to hold eye contact for a few seconds at a time - not too short to seem like you're not listening, but not too long to seem that you are staring into their soul
[S]
I hate eye contact but know it is expected, especially if you're asking for help. I look disgusting and want to avoid seeing the judgement in other peoples eyes. One thing that kinda worked was wearing some clear lens glasses instead of my proper ones. I am short sighted and thus those clear lens ones give me the comfort of the psychological barrier betwixt me and them AND since I cant make out their facial expressions I don't notice any urrrghhh reaction to me.

Really Pissed Off: I have had massive problems my whole life, as long as I can remember, have never fitted-in, never really understood why. But I'm starting to When I was nipper in primary school, I took some real shit. I was once massively embarrassed by a teacher, who put me before the class and smacked my arse. I hate her guts - and she's still a teacher, or was until recently. Why did she smack my arse, and humiliate me in class? I had a problem - a very noticeable one. I used to nod my head, fling my arms out, spit out, make grunting sounds, and whisper or shout out 'piss off fucking hell' very quickly, and over and over. I couldn't help this. It just came, and if I didn't, it felt like I would burst. My family went back to our GP again and again and a-fucking-gain. I was in my first year of primary school when my arse was smacked, so I was pretty young. I did get to finally see a child psychiatrist in my first year of secondary - I was 11. That's a long time to go through highly toxic, stigmatizing, destructive shite, that makes you a massive laughing stock, and target for bullies, both child and adult. What did the psychiatrist conclude, after just about six sessions in the child guidance clinic? That I was 'well-adjusted', and there was nothing to worry about. Wow. And guess what? The same psychiatrist I read about in the local paper some years later, was sent to prison for being a dirty pedophile, who abused kids in his inpatient facility. Another wow. I wasn't an inpatient. I was an outpatient. But does a man who has a sexual interest in young children, have their best interests at heart? Does he fuck. He was a proper sadistic twat, who I maintain got off on fucking kids up, by leaving them untreated and in the shit. I believe I was deliberately case-closed with what at the time, was clearly Tourettes. My life is in ruins in some, if not all, respects. I have never had a career or anything productive to do, I do not connect with people all that well, I have no reliable circle of friends, I have no satisfactory intimate relationship. I had my last girlfriend at 16, and it lasted a week. I have had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and have recently been diagnosed with ASD. There are very suspect and highly questionable logs - both NHS and policing - attached to my address. I was first arrested in my 40's, and had no criminal or forensic history prior to that. I have NEVER been taken to court, despite trying in my own way, to secure some judicial and legal review of my situation. I wonder fucking why? Answers on a post card. Innit. LOL. You're supposed to receive a conviction notice or similar aren't you, when professionals in your care, are had up for serious offences. I have been ambushed too. I think the cowardly fucks in the NHS and the Police want to paint a bad a picture of me as they can, to cover their own dirty, sorry backsides.
[S]
When I was arrested by the Counter Terrorism Police in 2010, I was sectioned. I made it clear I would have a proper pop at them and the NHS in court. One of the officers said he was keen to see me 'get the help and support' I needed. He, for his own part, probably meant it. I was sectioned, and left to the dirty twats in the NHS. I have tried long and hard to resolve this matter. But so far, I have only spoken to the Police and the NHS themselves about the matter. Sometimes nicely. Sometimes not so nicely. It was recently said: 'have you ever known the coppers not to respond to someone so distressed....' I made two 999 calls, and the Police threatened me saying: 'Don't call again. Or we'll come and see you'. Wow. Just fucking Wow. Talking to the Police and the NHS about this now is a fat, useless, waste of time. But there is such a thing as charitable and unbiased victim support. And there are such a thing as journalists and lawyers The Police and the NHS officials who have been involved in my case, need to know that no matter how much shit they throw in my direction, and no matter how black a picture their stitch-up ambush seeks to paint of me, that will reflect on them also. And much, much more than they have prepared for. They have had their chance, and now I am taking it forward, to an open court if necessary. And there's nothing they can do about it. I intend to hold the professionals as accountable as possible, and metaphorically rip their fucking heads off and their hearts out, and lay them to waste on their own turf I am going to make them known, and put an end to them.

You're very brave to decide to share your issues - it's really hard to open up - I was the same.. However the forum is really good to get to know other people who can identify with how you feel and offer support - and it's SO much easier to do it anonymously.. You sound a bit lost in your life.... You seem to struggle socially and also you don't seem to have a solid sense of identity.. Not feeling like you fit in anywhere.. I also feel a lot like you.. I find social situations an absolute nightmare firstly.. I never have made the same connections along the way of life like my siblings did with other people...you know - at school, university, work.... I was always on my own.... Always wearing the mask and changing personality depending on the situation I was in... I'm now 42, married with 3 children... so at 26 and realizing you may have issues makes you streets ahead of me I never realized there was a 'name' for the way I was... In fact it was only when I went to my doctor almost 3yrs ago that I truly realised that the way I was wasn't 'normal' I am since diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder along with Depression.. I'm in therapy since my first doc apt and also see a Psychiatrist... Have you ever spoken to your GP about how you feel? Generally this is the first real step towards getting the help that you need... Maybe from there you could see a therapist and talk about how you feel and what's going on for you... It's amazing to have a 3rd party who doesn't know anyone in your family - totally unjudgemental.. It has taken me a long long time to build up trust - as trusting is not my strong area...but now I find her invaluable. You definitely sound as if you could do with help... I won't hazzard a guess as to what type of 'diagnosis' you might get or not because you really need to see a medical person to know for sure... So do think about opening up to your GP and going from there... You're only 26 so it would be great if you could get help now while you're still so young Do keep talking here too. Mind yourself and hope I have been even a little bit helpful in my reply

How to control tics at some degree (from my personal experience). I am 18 now. I was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome approximately 2,5 years ago. I have noticed that changing place where you are located now (for example, going outdoor if tics started at home) can help a lot. I don`t have already that tics outdoor. They disappear. Certain tics are associated with certain enviroments, situations, people etc.

I had dyskinesia of my tongue and mouth just over a year ago, amd I still do to a much milder extent. It was caused by antipsychotic drugs...in particular the less sedating older ones, although years of AP's in general could not have helped. I thimk for people in there mid twenties (my age), obvious TD is still relatively umcommon. Only yesterday I was told I will still have to avoid non sedating and older antipsychotics. Whatever the theoretical debates on this about the risks of different antipsychotics, it seems the general consensus and reality (in my view amd experience) is that certain antipsychotics place us at higher risk than others, although that is not to say they are less safe overall. I don't think SSRI's would give you TD, as that's not the way they work. I heard that lithium can, in extremely rare circumstances, cause TD - although I don't know how true this is. About the relationship betweem TD and tourettes - it seems unlikely, as older dopamime blocking drugs (that very heavily target what they call the nigrostriatal pathway - drugs doing this are a cause of TD and movement problems) are sometimes used to TREAT tourettes!
[S]
I’d also look into why exactly this is causing you stress... being asked to sit with workmates, teambuilding lunches, it doesn’t sound like it should be causing stress. Similarly it’s kind of normal to be open to a certain extent when with others. So if this is causing you stress, perhaps there is some other underlying cause? What Poopy Doll said about the forces is also probably right, that the kind of attitudes towards “building character” there are even more old school then at other institutions. It’s worth thinking about what you are letting yourself in for...

Tourettes & Tardive dyskinesia: I've read another thread about tardive dyskinesia and I'm concerned about this and wondered if anyone could give me any information on this condition and whether or not it may relate to what I have been through over the last 3-5 years. It may be completely unconnected.... My sons and my sister both had tics / ADD up until puberty. It was never determined whether Tourettes was the main or secondary diagnosis. I was not affected, but given the hereditary aspect, I am concerned that I may be at risk with dopamine antagonists and that this may have been the cause. I suffered extreme withdrawl problems (jaw clenching, parkinson type movements, extreme sweating and temperature control problems and autonomic nervous system failures) when I came off Escitalopram. I also suffered coronary muscle spasms during this period which the doctors couldn't explain. I was left with a slow and irregular heart beat.When I first took the drug I couldn't shut my eyes (literally) for 3 days and I felt "wired".... they reduced it to 5mg for two weeks and then kept me on it on a 10mg dose. All this was for very mild anxiety and depression. The "withdrawl" symptoms lasted for about 3 and a half years and 1 year in they gave me a pacemaker as it was clear that my heart muscle wasn't recovering. The symptoms waxed and waned during that period and 5 years later the other symptoms have petered out and pretty much gone, although I am left with a pacemaker. I was on the drug (on and off) for 7 years at a low dose and had no symptoms until I stopped taking it. I read in this information that Tourettes is a risk factor and that some SSRIs have been implicated as causing tardive dyskinesia. Does anyone know anything about this? Could I carry the gene for Tourettes if my sons have inherited it and my sister had it too? I didn't suffer myself. My doctor has referred me to a psych who seems intent on proving "health anxiety" or "personality disorder." Borderline PD is apparently characterised by intense emotions which are capable of inducing autonomic dysfunction, and the doctor's take seems to be that I had a heart problem anyway (!!!) (No family history, no risk factors, age 45 and no problems prior to taking the drug) and that BPD and intense health anxiety could cause me to have "imagined" that the autonomic problems were the fault of the drug. The psych seems to think I should go back on the drug....some kind of "exposure therapy".....He can forget it!! I also read a little about trauma causing this condition to develop/worsen. I was traumatised by being told I had suffered a heart attack (initially), and then by being told I would need heart surgery (pacemaker) and then being told that my autonomic nervous system wasn't working properly. It caused me to develop a deep depression and significant anxiety. Frankly I'm disgusted and insulted that they can dismiss this as "imagined" symptoms. They were very real and the pacemaker in my chest kind of proves that I didn't imagine that part! My mental health has fallen apart since and I'm struggling to be taken seriously as a result, because I'm angry and scared, and have become very negative. I'm really struggling with this. Can anyone shed any light? Does anyone know anything about Escitalopram and dopamine? I'd be really grateful for any information.
[S]
The information I read earlier stated that this condition could be sparked by any substance / drug which "disagreed" with a patient. It cited sertraline and one other SSRI which had provided evidence of patients being diagnosed with this condition on withdrawl. So SSRIs can affect you too perhaps. There is perhaps less evidence with these drugs being less "heavy duty" than the anti-psychotics and perhaps having been observed less...particularly the newere SSRIs - of which Escitalopram is one. I knew about the reporting system and did indeed report the drug using the yellow card system. I have tried for several years to be taken seriously over this, and have ended up in the psychiatrist's chair! He seems determined to trash my concerns. The cardiologists were far quicker to consider psychiatric drugs as the cause, although they felt that what I suffered could not be termed "withdrawl symptoms." I am questioning whether it is worth the fight. I am much better now and, in terms of my heart, nothing can be done. It is better perhaps to come to terms with it, limit further derrogatory psychiatric investigations and to deal with the resulting increase in anxiety as best I can with therapy. Seeking help from professionals who use pills is the last thing that I want....so why turn to drug prescribers for advice and help? That's my view, although the bitterness and anger still burns very deeply I must admit.

Here a couple of things I'd say to offer some support (although I am by no means a licensed professional): 1. Structure - You noted to us that whenever you're alone, your anxiety and depression get the best of you. I'm the same way (minus the depression), because my OCD makes me obsess a lot over little things. In general, I would recommend structure. Get out more often, find things to fill your time with—that are healthy—and do your best to lead a productive life. 2. Finding a Job - Finding a job sounds like it will be essential to your recovery path. What I would recommend is asking your clinical supports (e.g counselor) if there are any rehab programs that help mentally ill people find employment. In my state of Massachusetts, we have an organization called MRC that does just that. My hope is that those options will be made available to you. However, I would also say to take it easy. While money is a present problem for you, putting too much pressure on yourself over finding a job while you're already on a bumpy road will exacerbate your symptoms. You want to ensure you're stable going into a job. 3. Coping Skills - Coping skills are also imperative to your overall mental health. Everyone needs them. When you have moments of self-doubt, ask yourself some questions: "What makes this not my fault?" "What can I do to help myself?" Something else that will help is giving yourself self-soothing. Coloring, writing, drawing, listening to music, meditation, and exercise are all healthy examples of coping mechanisms that are recommended by clinical professionals. They keep us feeling strong and help us keep our minds in the right place. 4. Give Yourself a Break - You're not to blame for everything. It really is unfortunate that you've lost so many people, and I'm very sorry that all of these difficulties are piling up on your shoulders, but there is a lot of hope still in store for you. You have to be easy on yourself, and recognize that we're only human. Pace your recovery and make sure your counselor is aware of how you feel. If you need any further encouragement or support, let me know!
