"I wish I could go back in time and protect myself from the pain, trauma, and abuse I ended up experiencing from my ex-gf as well as my ex-best friend.
Even though I try to remind myself that it isn’t shameful to be caring and empathetic, I nonetheless feel so much regret, shame, and disappointment, and I am haunted every day by PTSD from betrayal, assault, and heartbreak.
Although I feel some measure of pride and relief that I am the type of person to take ownership of my mistakes and learn from them, I am disgusted and terrified for the people they interact with, because they definitely aren’t.
Personally, I’m exhausted by other people’s bullshit. I disapprove of doubting people by default, but definitely, if someone is actually showing conflicting signals, even if it’s subtle, please listen to your instincts and drop/drift away from the person ASAP to save yourself some heartache. Like yes, no one is wholly good or bad, but there’s a distinct line beteeen character quirks / weaknesses and flaws that tend to result in abusive, toxic, and/or invalidating behavior. I’m still trying to be cognizant of this myself so that I’m not too forgiving in the future.
P.S. I’m going to give one identifying demographic - I’m female. Just to bring attention to the queer community and so that people don’t automatically assume I’m male because I mention an ex-gf. But yeah. Abuse and sexual harassment / assault happen between two women as well (and naturally, between other genders too)."

"Hello does anyone here suffer from depersonalisation/ derealisation? Basically it is the feeling of disconnect from yourself and other and reality. Like watching a movie of yourself. People usually have similar feelings when high or drunk.
From what I hear people usually get it from lack of social interaction/ being alone.
I just got this a few weeks ago and it is the scariest thing ever. I look into the mirror and my family members and dont recognise them. It has made my stress levels and anxiety to skyrocket past what they already are and made it hard to eat and i am losing a lot of weight.
Ive never though of myself as antisocial but I stopped socialising to many people so I could just focus on my schoolwork about a year ago. I got better grades and was eating better but now this happened and im scared to death.
When I talk to people it gets slightly better but I dont know anyone well enough to have long conversations with over many days.(basically a friend).
Would anyone out there who has or does not have this be willing to talk to me/ get lunch for a while or let me join there friend group to help me break out of this?(basically do friend things and talk and stuff)
Im not one to write stuff like this but I am very scared and alone right now and I have no one else to turn to. Hopefully some bruins out there can help out a fellow bruin. And only comment if you want to actually help me because I really need help."

They have the passion and charisma that I and so many others around me have lost. "

- You did it for a very good, passionate reason, and you should always keep that in the forefront of your mind. That passion is your individuality and the focus that will sustain you.

You are not alone. Scream until you're listened to. Scream until your pain is heard. It's easier to feel your bones shake and to break down in the office of a psychiatrist than it is to wear the same disguise of "everything is okay" when nothing is right. And it's fine if other people find out that you aren't okay because one day you will be. Maybe not now. Maybe not tomorrow. But one day you will be. That's how getting better works. It's a process. Go talk to your doctor or your insurance company or walk into urgent care and say you need help. Do what you need to do to get better and that ALWAYS involes getting help from others. "

"I wonder everyday if I am worth living. I knew I was a piece of shit. I have shitty personality, I am not smart, I am not good looking, and I am not a great person at all. Coming to college, I knew making friends would be hard and I knew especially someone with my shitty personality, I knew I wasnt going to make friends. It hurts though. I don't want to kill myself because I want to believe life will get better. I feel lonely, lost, betrayed, and unmotivated. I feel angry at myself because I cant grow faster enough to be a better individual.I also drown my thoughts by getting busy but that makes me fell worse.
I also don't want to share this to my parents because they will worry and I don't want to share to my friends because my mental health problem seems so small.
Does anyone know what to do?"
[.C]
"So sorry to hear that life had been tough.
Let me see if I have your story straight. You feel worthless because of your personality, ie a core part of you that you feel you cannot change. You think that people would not like or want to be friends with you. You probably stick to yourself and not actively try to make friends or you do and you fail. This makes you feel worthless again and continues the loop.
Your feels, thoughts, and behavior is conspiring against you. This is a classic example a downward spiral.
Please visit CAPS at your next convenience. Once you see your therapist, tell then that you are spiraling. They will help you.
Your problem is not small. It is growing but it can be nipped in the bud. You sound motivated to change and really self aware, so I know you can do this!"
[.C]
"To OP:

First, I am so sorry that you are going through this. I have dealt with many similar feelings that you are going through right now. In the past I’ve struggled to have a sense of self-worth and self-confidence, and though I have gotten better these feelings still persist to an extent today.

Second, I want to assure you that things, though will take time, will get better, even if you may not feel so. Trust me, I’ve felt that way a lot too, where I thought things would not get better. But as long as you try to make things better, even if they are small steps, trust me, they will get better.

Lastly, I want to assure you that you are worthy of being here, and no one deserves to feel how you are feeling.

Please feel free to message me if you want to talk. Also I encourage you to try out CAPS, but I understand if you don’t find it helpful (I personally didn’t find it that helpful for me as I prefer to talk to friends or at least peers about my problems)."

"It is a shame your self-worth is so low. But, it doesn’t have to be. Your life and your attitude towards it is self-determined. If you have a “shitty” personality, change it to a pleasant one.

Don’t think suicide ever. You can do this because it isn’t that hard. It is simply a choice to be made. Good luck."

"To my fellow bruins suffering with depression and mental illnesses.
"Things will get better"
Let me tell you this is the biggest lie in the history of lies. People tell me this all the time--when I'm having suicidal thoughts, after a suicide attempt, and even when I'm strapped to a hospital bed. They've told me this after they learned how I was destroyed as a child by other people.
They are wrong. Things are the same.
What has happened, has happened. I can't change what I was given and what I've seen. I can't change OR forget my past. (yes, someone has told me to "just forget about it." (what an ignorant idiot they are))
But, I'll tell you one thing:
Things don't get better, we get better.
This is not to imply people with depression and mental illness are flawed.We aren't. But, as time goes on, we get more resistant to the urges to die, to the thoughts, voices, moods etc. We get better as in we fight back with greater force and resistance.
One day, I hope I will be so resistant that I won't need to rely on friends to help me with these battles.
As well, ignore the ignorant. They can't even fathom it. Whenever I mention traumas, I hear this special breed of people they say that I'm being "dramatic" or trying to "one them up" with my experiences. They can't understand and get upset when you tell them they can't. Ignore them, they aren't worth your company or your time. Focus on the people who believe you. Those people will be your friends, and they will help you.
Last notes:
-Taking medications is a good thing if it helps you! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As well, don't be afraid to start antidepressants, you can always stop.
-If you have a strong urge to end it, wait a little bit. Usually, these feelings fade in a bit. As well, talk to a friend who you can trust.
-It doesn't hurt to seek help from professionals.
Finally:
If you are extremely depressed/suicidal and really need to talk and don't feel comfortable doing any of the above things.
You can make a fake account and say that you need some help in the comments. I'm down to talk or anything and will probably reach out to you.
A fine day to you all.
As well, people who can't understand this kind of stuff: It is not a joke. Do not make jokes and be respectful!"

"...The good news: it's even simpler than that. Obviously it'll vary based on the circumstances some, but basically you just have to fill out the readmission application, talk to an adviser, and make a contract about how many classes you can take and when and what grades you need to achieve, etc.

... And then you enroll in your classes like usual (usually through UNEX in what's called "concurrent enrollment") and move on.

"I am suicidal since I got major depression and anhedonia from LSD/MDMA combo 2 months back. Ive been going to therapy and its useless. They do mindfulness acceptance exercises but its all pointless. The fact is--and I told my therapist this--that unless this resolves in another month or two im out of here and will just kill myself. I dont give any fucks about mindful this or mindful that or CBT this or CBT that.
One fact is I will NOT and I REFUSE to deal with a mental health condition i did not have before. If I cannot live my life the way I did before the mental condition, then i will not live my life. I will say bye to all my friends and family and it will be a sad tragedy but tbh there is no point in living with this condition anyways. And Meds dont work either.
I had a pretty bright future as an engineering major but no more. I will not be tolerating this much longer especially given that therapy isnt curing me. Therapy is actually making me more suicidal by giving me dumb mindfulness exercises. The fact is therapy does not cure this and if I do not get cured then i see no point in living.
I had 0% anhedonia before and for me even a drop of anhedonia is too much anhedonia. Mathematically, that is infinitely more than before and thus unacceptable and I will just kill myself.
Anyways--I still have some hope. Has anybody done any rapid antidepressant therapy to get rid of all the symptoms such as ECT (electroconvulsion therapy)? Im scared of memory loss but hey its better than suicide right?"
#uclasecretsmentalhealth
[.C]
"While you have no reason to listen to this, you don't know me and you seem to be very set in your decision, please don't kill yourself. Depression and anhedonia are terrible, and living with them is horrible but please give it some more time. This is a brain injury, not unlike a concussion or a stroke and it takes time to heal. The brain is incredibly slow at healing itself. It often takes months and several different medications before you find the right one to mitigate the symptoms for you. Please, just don't give up so soon. While memory loss is better than suicide, the possibility of being able to feel happiness is even better than that. Just a little more time OP, for your friends, your family, but most importantly for yourself. You can get through this. Let the people around you support you and if you need more than that, we can change the first sentence I said and you can message me.

"Does anyone else ever feel like you have a bunch of acquaintances, but nobody really wants to spend much time with you aside from a "hello", maybe even a quick hug? Close relationships have always been hard to come by for me.I think I'm a decent person--that I'm generally kind, compassionate, and sensitive to the needs and emotions of others. Sometimes I even feel like I am a bit of an "old soul" in a sense because I am mature beyond my years in some ways even though I still have a slightly dirty sense of humor. Not to mention romantic relationships. I have never had a boyfriend and I am a couple of years older than most college seniors.I'm not extraordinarily gorgeous but I also think I am not terribly bad looking. Sometimes I feel like people don't like me, and I tell myself that it's just all in my head or I just haven't given them a chance to like me because I keep to myself too much. But other times I think it's true, that people really don't see much value in being my friend/don't like me. I think it's normal for everyone to have people that don't like them. But when does it reach the point at which so many people don't like you that there must be something wrong with you? That people never respond to your texts or emails--because they don't like you or because they're busy? Surely if you were somewhat important to them they would answer at some point. I guess what I'm trying to say is: How many people that don't like you does it take to prove that you're just not likable? Like maybe if it's a small group--maybe 5 people- that doesn't like you, then surely it's on them for not liking you--there's nothing wrong with you/your personality/your characteristics. But if a huge number of people dislike you, then doesn't that say something about you, not them? I know getting people to like you should never be the goal in life, but if none of your peers like you, if you have no friends--what to do? I often feel that I can go the whole day at school without speaking to anyone except maybe a few words. Maybe that's why I talk so much at home... "

"You talk about yourself as a decent person with decent qualities, but likeable is not one of them. Would you find yourself likeable at all?

Are you being too hard on yourself by defining likeable as "having the approval of people who will genuinely like me, text me, and email me whenever I message them"? Is it more assumable to think that keeping to yourself too much is making it hard for people to find things in common with you?"

"Acquiring true friends takes a lot of work. Most people don't take the time to filter out those who really don't fit their life. So, I would recommend taking a close look at your acquaintences and figure out who you think would add value to your life. Then, carefully but frequently, invite them personally (not an email or text) to get together with you for a meal or a drink. Then, when you're together, focus exclusively on that person. Ask about their interests, their likes and dislikes etc. If they ask about you, answer simply without long explanations. They will react very positively to that experience and you'll be well on your way to creating a very special bond with them. If you see a guy to whom you are attracted, just be very nice to him and he'll soon get the idea that you're interested. Good luck!"

"I am a former bruin, Asian female, who is currently going to law school in a southern state. I really miss how inclusive UCLA was. Here, I often face subtle discrimination which just feels normal now. Two times in the beginning of this semester when I spoke in one of my small class, the professor very subtly ignored me and moved on. She acted as if she was responding to me but she actually talked about something completely different that I was very confused. Second time when it happened, she later addressed what I said during the class without addressing me, and criticized what I said (in a way ""saying such thing"") and it was very apparent to other people that she was criticizing my action. Also, even though she encourages students who normally don't volunteer in the class to speak more, she ignores when I raise my hand and calls everyone else who usually dominates the class. That happened twice and I stopped bothering to raise my hand. Recently, I submitted a research summary about a topic that I am interested in for my final research paper, and she sent me an email saying I sound so knowledgeable and she is wondering if I already know a lot about the topic. It is very frustrating how my good faith effort in researching and putting time in choosing the topic is just going to be interpreted that way by the professor who is going to grade my work. I replied with the sources I used and told her that I do not actually know a lot but did not hear any response yet.
It is frustrating because every other students think she is a very nice person and would not think that she is doing this. She was also very nice to me when I was in her office hour that I cannot tell if she does this intentionally/consciously. Last year, my Asian friend who was in her class experienced the same situation and reported her to three different officials at school but no one was willing to take an action. The student affairs dean told my friend that it will only put her at disadvantage and do nothing to the professor if she were to seek further action. I will probably go to the professor's office hour tomorrow to address her email and my research paper in general. Any suggestion on how I should talk during the office hour? " #uclasecretsquestion

"Act as if you suspect nothing. You don't have any 'ammunition' to use to do anything other than trying your best to get through the class and into another professor's class who will likely also do the same.

"I have a friend who got dumped by a guy she liked over the summer and I’m really worried about her. She was getting over him at the beginning but she recently found out some gossip about him having a new girl now and that put her back at square zero. When you ask her about it she says that she is ok but she’s really not. Something about her has changed and she’s become obsessed about her weight. She’s lost about 20 lbs and keeps talking about wanting to lose 20 more but she will be really thin then. She hasn’t been eating much either and she used to love eating. I’m worried to the point where I’ve come close to messaging the guy and asking him to talk to her."

And we aren't like super close, but we've recently become better friends, and I can see myself having more romantic inclinations eventually?

"During my freshman year I was incredibly lonely. I ate at the dining halls by myself, I didn't talk to anyone on my floor, and I never went out on the weekends or even on my birthday. I knew it was my fault for being so shy, but I always felt like I was doing college wrong because everyone else was going out and having so much fun. Things are better for me now, but I still remember what it was like to be that lonely, so whenever I recognize an acquaintance sitting by themselves in lecture, I try to sit with them, even if I have other friends in the class. Especially if they're transfer students, since I know that makes it so much harder. I know it's easy to feel lonely in a place like UCLA, but that's going to keep happening if we don't open ourselves to new people. If you have a "clique" or friend group, consider opening it up to a stranger that you like. Or if you want to get to know a classmate better, have you and your friends sit with them in lecture. You could be saving someone's life, or at the very least make someone's day. And even if they actually want to be alone and you're bothering them, they'll make it clear, and you can just brush it off and go back to the comfort of your friends. I'm a shy introvert and I hate talking to people, but I also hate the idea of someone feeling like they don't belong due to loneliness."

I am doing relatively ok now, but I feel hurt, I just wish people would say what they mean and when they make a commitment stick with it. I want her to do this if this is the best thing for her, but it seems like she should have known earlier. I am thinking this may not be a juicy enough secret to get posted, but this girl meant so much to me, the only girl I have wanted for all of 2017 and my heart breaks because I feel like we went from being great friends to her being upset at me when I did nothing. It is too bad that she will never know the full extent of what she meant to me, she saved my life several times. If she somehow ever sees this I want her to know I am not mad, just sad at how everything ended."

"I'm honestly surprised after what happened in Las Vegas and the extent of that horrific tragedy, nothing happened at all afterwards except lower morale. No changes to policies or laws, not even a well-known, national public discussion as for ways to prevent future mass murders.
Gun control (stricter or more relaxed) shouldn't be the only issue of discussion here. Mental health is another. Psychology third.
We should be understanding the thought processes behind these murderers and why they believe in killing. We should be looking for ways to dispel that wicked and demented belief at every opportunity.
Take a look at today (November 5th) in Texas. 25+ more innocent lives gone. Millions more will have to go to their Sunday services or other places of worship with the unnecessary fear of being attacked. Security will be tightened, our freedoms possibly further restricted, and the process repeats itself again unfortunately.
How much longer do we have to go through this before someone finally calls for a public debate in looking for legislative answers to mass murders?"
[.C]
"What would you like to have done? The only gun control that is actually even slightly correlated to lowering gun deaths is absolute seizure of guns which is the dumbest idea ever. Mass murders account for roughly 0.1% of all gun deaths. Furthermore, gun control only targets rifles which while scary to look at contribute to a small fraction of gun deaths. The point I’m trying to make about the experiment we know as “gun control” is that there is zero correlation between legislative acts and lowering of gun deaths for the simple reason of... if you plan on committing a crime with a gun, the gun itself being illegal is irrelevant.

Furthermore, when has further legislation ever prevented more crime? For instance how many deaths has making schools gun free zones prevented. How many deaths have bullet buttons and 30 round mags prevented. The answer is zero because those are all obtainable.

I️ support legislation on stricter background checks and such and I️ support harsher sentences on owning illegal firearms and crimes for using them. Other than that, aside from outright mass confiscation, there’s nothing to be done."

"Honestly since coming to college, I've really stopped feeling any emotions. Bottling up my emotions has been a way of coping with the stressors of life but it's reached a point where its not healthy. No one knows I'm hurting, no one knows I'm stressed and sometimes I don't even know if I'm hurting or stressed. There's not a lot of things that trigger an emotional response such as happiness or sadness. I almost got jumped and I didn't even feel a thing. My emotions are neutral but I have rbf so everyone thinks I'm mad or angry. They tell me to smile more but I can't smile if I don't really feel anything. I can still empathize with people but its difficult to express my own emotions or even know if I am feeling anything. This stoicism makes it hard to connect with people because I either come off as cold and unfeeling or an arrogant asshole. Thoughts?"

Every time I asked her to go to dinner or just study together, she would turn me down.

Another possibility is she met another guy and he doesn't like her hanging around you all the time. Or she wants to focus on schoolwork and finds hanging out with you distracting.

"He claimed that he wanted to talk to me about a club he was in. I obliged to a dinner at a dining hall. He was a true conversationalist, but he was bitter. He had hatred in the way he talked about humans, and he was hung up about the past. Somehow we ended up in my floor's lounge, and he started making moves on me. He slid his hand down my leg. I didn't do anything. I was shocked. At that point I was naive and did not know to put my guard up around guys. I just wanted to talk. He manipulated me into my room. We had sex. I didn't want to. This began two surreal months, as I continued to sleep with my abuser and I became more and more depressed and stuck in an abusive spiral.
He was obsessed with a past girl that he had slept with. She had a boyfriend then. He probably manipulated her too. He would talk about how she was the one, how she was his soulmate, and I would listen. He claimed she was still into him. I don't know why I did, but I tried hard to empathize with him as I hurt inside. He put me down, he belittled my abilities, my opinions, and idealist tendencies. He had delusions of grandeur. He was going to be one of the greats, he would leave a legacy on humanity. He thought everyone was stupid. He once flashed and held a pocket knife against throat as I struggled against him. It was just a joke.
I finally broke in the end. I told him I can't do this anymore. He didn't say anything. He raped me again that night."

"Being an underachiever, I can't tell how much the Simpsons episode 'Bart Gets An F' gets to me whenever I watch it. Studying all night and stocked on adderall in a ridiculously competitive class, I go to the final thinking that I'm going to ace it and this is literally the very best that I can do, that I cannot top this performance. Maybe my parents will understand that.
I come out of the final and feel satisfied about it, and am pretty happy I got done with it after all this hardwork. Then I get to when the results are announced, in a week or two. I barely come near an 80 and with the curve I'm lucky so I get a B-. What do I say? What did I do wrong? I did everything I could, but here I am. Interviewers will look at this and spout the usual "but if you're really interested in the material, it would show in your grades" or at least make that face when they see your GPA.
Is it my poor attention? I'm not sure, but when things like this keep subtly telling you that you're disappointing, it starts to get to you. I never got close to a 3.5, heck even a 3.2. IFYP Bart"

"Why do you want good grades? Grades are just one of the indicators for how well you know the material of a class. It was designed to fit everybody, so in reality it fits no one. It is by far not the only indicator for how good you are in your field. It's up to you how much importance you want to prescribe to it. I was never a great studier or a fast learner, so I had a lower GPA than most of my friends. But for me, school wasn't about grades. School was an opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn, and a degree was just a stepping stone to future jobs. So I didn't stress so much about my grades, paid attention to the classes I liked, and focused the rest of my energy on personal projects. I never even put my GPA on my resume, my projects filled the gap, and I landed decent internships (tho some companies did ask for my GPA. I stopped caring about such closed-minded companies). Point is, there are so many other ways to get a job, like networking or doing research or getting recs. School isn't all about grades, it means whatever you want it to mean. So figure out what you want to get out of it, focus on what you're good at, and don't waste your four years trying to meet other people's standards."
[.C]
"Honestly, it takes a lot to get good grades here. If you have any sort of social life or a job, I'm amazed if you do well. I stress out and have mini breakdowns every quarter.. just do your best and don't let it kill you. Also, don't snort the adderall.. I know it's more fun, but it doesn't work the way it is supposed to if you snort it.. hope that helps. Lol."
[.P]51
"I seek solace in reading success stories of people who had rough circumstances but managed to be really successful in the end. I do this because I graduated with a 2.5 GPA & no internships from UCLA and I occasionally I have that depressing day when all I could think about are all the opportunities that are lost and can no longer pursue (grad school....). I made my mistakes back in the day, but today, I am much more mature and I have come to learn that the true recipe to any form of success is self-discipline. A combination of lack of discipline and having no clue what future I wanted for myself is what put me into this mess.
Don't be like me and screw up, because you'll certainly run into roadblocks and work much harder in the end (and have depressing days like me today lol). Study, even if you don't feel like it; go workout, even if you don't feel like it; go to office hours, even if you don't feel like it. It's ALWAYS going to be a battle between that voice inside your head saying, "I can do it later," and you, the TRUE decision maker. Try to think of that voice in your head as if it was someone else trying to tell you what to do and doing the complete opposite because you ain't no lil bitch and nobody is going to tell you what to do but you lol. Reaching a true level self-discipline means being able to ignore that voice in your head that is constantly saying "maybe later" and instead getting to work and putting in 200% of your effort into it, even if you feel like utter crap doing it. Forget about motivation too--motivation is fleeting and fickle, discipline is dependable and reliable.
Finally, although not completely related, but here's my favorite quote for the past few weeks:
“It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.”
(stop fkn caring what other people think of you and do whatever makes you feel confident and great...but also never forget to always be nice to other people haha)"

" I disagree. I've found that if required tasks lead to procrastination, then - potential mental health issues aside - maybe you don't really want to do the thing, and should consider options which you actually enjoy doing (this is especially applicable to significant others). This is the only life you get, and your youth is fleeting - I promise that if you spend it disciplining yourself into following a path you're not enthusiastic about, you'll just grow to be a bitter and hateful adult who never stops wondering "what if?""
[.C]
" Best create opportunities from here.

That being said, it will take time. Don’t mean to be hard, but mentality shifts when we are either in stress or feeling good. Never feel like you are holding yourself back.

Do what you can do and feel bad if you are late bloomer at the same time. Individually, your determination can offer a lot more."

"Can anyone give me some advice: I am a 4th year MIMG major with a 3.0GPA. I've always wanted to become a doctor. I used to be a great student until I came to UCLA. I used to know how to manage time, I used to know how to get great test scores.. And now I am empty because I feel that I am a different person. I feel I have no way of getting into med school with my 3.0 GPA while fellow classmates have 3.8's with stellar MCAT scores applying. All I have are a few volunteering experiences and 3 years of experience working as an employee in Reagan MC. I haven't even taken MCATS because I feel like I won't even qualify, and it will set me back about $5-10k for med school expenses to end up not getting accepted. Any advice, comments, experiences welcome"

"I just met a woman who graduated from UCSF med school after completing her MPH at Johns Hopkins. BUT she did all of that after taking 4 gap years because she graduated from UCLA with a 2.6 GPA. In those gap years she worked on research that she was really passionate about. As long as you pursue your passions and really show growth in your gap years, anything is possible. If you really want to be a doctor, you will be. Perseverance is the epitome of the medical journey. Good luck, stay strong, and stay motivated. You'll get there. and. don't. compare. yourself. to. others."
[.C]
"AAMC provides financial aid thru their "Finacial Assistance Program" that gives you reduced price in MCAT fees and free year subscription for MSAR (provides full admission stats for med schools). For your grade, look into post bacc/SMP/master programs!! Each program have their pros and cons, but you pretty much need to prove that you can handle a full academic load AND do well. I'm recent physiology major grad who graduated and currently enrolled at CSULA's academic enhancer post bacc. I'm doing really well and will most likely raise my gpa by 0.2!!! It's ok to take time and get it right, even if you already graduated. Good luck to you and anyone else 🙂"
[.C]
"People can give constructive advices.... but reality is.... you have little to no chance to get into good med schools with a 3.0 GPA! I am not sure about schools in states like Kentucky or Kansas though 😕. Maybe go for master first! Or post bacc to improve your GPA! Or get into research! Theres also other good paying health professions available such as pa, nursing, dentistry, radiology, etc! Good luck"
[.C]
" I would suggest trying your best to ace the MCAT and applying broadly (may be consider DO schools). They can’t accept you if you don’t apply. So if your dream of becoming a doctor is big enough, you should try your best in subsequent steps and apply! Good luck!"
[.C]
"No matter how much you may think your peers have over you, realize that the strangers on the application-evaluation committee (and in the job market) have seen dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of applicants in the past that're better than all of you - and they know from experience that numbers are not people.

Sell yourself - in writing and in person. There is more substance to every person than can be notated on an application, and it's your job to show the remaining bits of who you are - and THOSE bits are the ones that will matter most, in the end."
[.C]
"You are going to need to really kill a postgrad program. It is definitely not worth it to apply as is."

"
I mentally buried and justified my molester for over ten years because I didn't want to believe that I was a person who could be repeatedly molested.
Hey, maybe he was just tickling me. Well, it's not as bad as rape, so I can't tell anyone about it. I'm sure he didn't mean any harm, right?
Now I'm suffering the effects of those justifications as I try to piece together my memories and move on.

"I think you should stop this "i havent met the one" type of mindset. Everyone you meet, in your classes, in your clubs, in your whatever, has the potential to be your friend or best friend.

There are some relationships that on paper should've been a match made in heaven for friendship and they should've ended up being each other's best man or bridesmaid. But if you just expect things to fall into place and that friendship to grow then you're wholly mistaken by how friendships are even formed in the first place.

There are some friends out there that have nothing in common but still somehow stay friends, because they worked at it, they kept at each other's lives and learned how to be friends with each other."

"I think everyone finds friends differently. Perhaps you find a friend by posting to the UCLA Secrets page and friend-ifying commenters? :) *hint hint*"

"Last Thanksgiving my cousin's new wife, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white girl called me and the rest of my Mexican family racist cuz we said "white privilege exists." It takes a lot of white privilege to be white and call minorities racist. #cringegiving."

"I had a lovely Thanksgiving with my family until my mom brought up how Die Hard was her favorite Christmas movie.

Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! #CringeGiving."

"To the well-dressed boy who approached me at the edge of Washington Square Park on November 6th: I've never had anyone run after me just to politely introduce themselves, tell me they noticed me walking through the park, and that I looked pretty — that might just be one of the sweetest encounters with a stranger I've ever had.
I was actually having an overwhelmingly stressful day, and your thoughtful gesture really cheered me up! I greatly admire your courage (bolder than anything I could ever manage) and appreciate how courteous you were throughout our short conversation. Usually the type of guy to approach me is a serious creep, an asian fetishist, or someone who makes me feel unsafe walking around at night, so it was incredibly refreshing to meet someone so genuine and endearing.
As I mentioned (and I hope you didn't think I was lying to try to get out of anything), I do have a boyfriend of 4 years, and didn't feel it was appropriate to give you my number or stay in contact in any way. But I just felt horrible for leaving so suddenly (I was flustered and thought it was a prank/dare!) and wanted to get this message to you somehow. You seemed like a stellar guy and, objectively, you are also super good looking! Your next girlfriend found a keeper! Wishing you the best."

"Guess our professor forgot about daylight savings, cuz he took a look at his watch at 1 and said "all right, looks like we're out of time!"

"Last weekend, I hosted a halloween party, when friends went into my room to get something, found my American Whopper dildo instead, brought it outside into the living room and started tossing it around. By the end of the night, people were using it as microphones, trying to get the suction end to stick on the ceiling, and covering it in glitter makeup. It was all fine, until the next day, I noticed it was gone. My roommates and I turned our entire apartment upside down, and we still couldn't find it. it's been a week now, and we still have no idea where it is.
Tl;dr Somebody stole my dildo, and I have no idea what to do with my life now."

"As a man, I have been sexually assaulted by a woman in the past. I have wanted to join the #MeToo movement for some time now, but I’m afraid I’ll be ridiculed or berated. Every time I have told a friend about my experience I have always been told “It’s not a big deal, she was probably just messing around” or “well if she was hot, then why is it a problem?” Sexual assault is sexual assault, and I should be able to come clean about my experiences without being told they’re not real."

"Growing up, my parents at best, were emotionally neglectful and at worst, emotionally abusive. Since then, I've been forced to fend for myself in terms of providing myself emotional and mental support. I'm thankful they're paying for my college education but I sometimes wish they weren't. Aside from supporting me financially, which I greatly appreciate and am so thankful for, they constantly berate me, are condescending, and blame me for things that aren't my fault. I wish I could cut them off, but I know that I can't. Is it bad I'm sticking around just for the free tuition?"
[.C]
"My advice, ignore all the commenters here who clearly don't have sympathy for victims of abuse and speak to a therapist while doing some serious math on what your expenses and income potential is. Parental abuse and neglect is real and so is the financial decision to give up thousands and thousands of dollars. If they are really abusive, they know that paying for your college puts you in their debt, and paying for it yourself will put you in debt to the bank/government. There isn't one answer for this but I hope you figure out what's best for you."

"I hate my body. It faces a wage gap, underrepresentation in corporate boardrooms and poliitics, and stigma in society. Little kids watch Disney movies grow up learning that main characters don’t look like me. Adults watch movies learning that, too.
I was going to specify which trait I’m talking about, but it doesn’t matter. Just know there’s a whole underbelly of isms that aren’t talked about or stigmatized, but still damage lives."

"I read the secret about the Comic Sans font and literally felt stabbed in my heart. This makes me feel like I care too much about aesthetic and reminded me of this: I broke up with my last boyfriend because I met him during the winter but summer came around and he started wearing cargo shorts. I literally felt less attracted to him and couldn't continue on. I feel like I need help because I'm too shallow."

"If you prefer someone who takes pride in their appearance there's really nothing wrong with that. A bit harsh, but it's about the line you draw. Yours is at cargo shorts. Other people's may be at simply showering."

"Today, I had two of my best friends respectively cut me off. The first one told me he never cared about me, and the second one told me I was selfish, even though I comforted him after he sexually assaulted me. I can't tell if I'm unlucky or the world's worst person."
[.C]
"Let’s not overdramatize the situation. Two people don’t want to be your friend anymore. Life goes on. It doesn’t sound like you’re losing anything here. I’m a little doubtful of that sexual assault claim. Why would you comfort someone who just assaulted you?"

"I said a dude was handsome once like 2 weeks ago and now all my friends are literally pressuring me into being gay. They say things like "maybe you just don't know it yet" or "why don't you just try it?". Um maybe cuz I don't like men? I know they're trying to be supportive especially in this new social climate but enough is enough. I know I'm def not the most masculine guy and I've def had people mistake me for gay before, but if I say I'm not gay I'm not fucking gay and people need to stop needling me about it."

"I'm a straight guy and I'm legitimately confused as to what I'm supposed to be doing to support feminism in response to the "me too" movement. I feel like if I continue to just listen like they ask me to do then I get scrutinized for not taking any action, but then when I try to speak out in favor of faminsim, or actively try to promote the ideals and beliefs, I'm seen as a pseudo-feminist who isn't really able to understand what I'm talking about. I've talked to my female friends about ideas that I have to try to make a change and all I get is conflicting opinions saying that I shouldn't try to do anything as it would draw attention away from what matters, but then I constantly hear that it's time for men to do something. That's all I want to do, is to do something that will show women that men understand and are there to help without coming off as fake or taking the attention away from the issue at hand. Women, I'm on your side and I want to do something, but I just don't know what to do."

"The thing is that you can’t actually win in the world of neoliberal identity politics - anything you do or don’t do will be wrong. For this reason, I recommend thinking for yourself and ignoring the obscurantist nonsense that tells you that being a man somehow renders you incapable of doing so. Take a position, argue it, and fight for it. Those who tell you you’re not allowed to, either ignore them or try to get them to say something substantive about the issue. Be open, of course, to having your mind changed, but don’t let yourself be straightjacketed into thinking your identity somehow makes you incapable of thinking critically."

"I'm a Jew and I'm pro-Palestine. As much as I want to get involved with SJP, I can't because my family will disown me. I wish that more people would realize how intertwined this issue has become to Judaism itself. In hebrew school, we learned that Palestinians were evil murderers. Anyone who even asked for the other side of the story was severely punished. I hate that I feel like I have to choose between my Jewish identity and my political beliefs."

"I was drunk at a friend's house. Her roommate - a boy - offered to take me upstairs to his bedroom so I could sleep. He said he would sleep on the couch downstairs. But still, I wouldn't go with him until my other friend - a girl - went with me to make sure I was ok.
In the morning, I woke up and almost apologized to my friend's roommate because I felt I had made him feel awkward.
But I didn't apologize to him. While I'm sure he had no intention to harm me, I had no guarantee of that because as a woman, I've been conditioned to fear men's actions.
I'm thankful for my friend's roommate for being kind. He's a sweet guy. But if I had a dollar for every time a sweet guy turned out to be not so sweet, well, I'd obviously be very, very rich.
No more apology culture. Men, you've made this name for yourselves. Now fucking fix it."

"Wow, all the comments on here are stupid. She’s not entitled. She’s cautious because women have to deal with creepy shit from men constantly, so she didn’t go sleep in this random guy’s bed alone just to be safe.

"I got into a section of a language class where everyone else is from the same class beforehand, and I’m not into side talks during class (it wastes the professor’s time, and my money that I’m paying for the class). So I made a brilliant plan of doing a social experiment where I act like a complete asshole Sternie stereotype just in that class to gauge my classmates’ reactions, like making all my answers business related. It’s been entertaining as hell so far. I noticed that LS and Tisch students react/laugh at me the most, where CAS students are the most neutral. I look forward for my class every day to be the best asshole. It’s fantastic."

It honestly felt pretty crappy to do the wire transfer, since my parents recently just spend money freely and I know they're just going to use it to buy some more shit we don't need. I'm scared that this first payment will become standard, as proof that I am capable of continuously paying for my parents while I live under their roof. I'm even more scared I'll never be able to save up enough (exactly why I stayed at home in the first place after graduating) to move out somewhere worthwhile. Why should I feel obligated to do so much more for my parents than they ever did for theirs?."

After a few drinks, me and the guy start hooking up in the living room and things get really steamy. Literally the moment I yell out "Oh yes, daddy!" the front door swings open and my father, who doesn't know I'm gay walks in. We haven't spoken since. FML."

"If you were ever thinking about taking exams at the Moses center, I discourage you to do so. The environment is horrible and you are constantly being watched on cameras. They have falsely accused me of cheating twice. Their justification? I dropped a napkin and that apparently looked suspicious on cameras. I now have to deal with a number of staff members to prove my innocence. How are they helping people with learning disabilities if all they are doing is alleviating anxiety? The same goes for the Wellness exchange. The amount of times I have been dismissed, told to sleep on it etc. Seriously NYU. If you were easier to sue, I would be a fucking billionaire."

"This is absolutely terrible advice to anyone who has a disability and needs testing services. You should not discourage people from self-advocating and getting the resources and services they need."

"As a proud Sternie who sees the anti-Stern sentiment on this page and feels incredible sad about it ... why does everyone hate us? We're following our passions, just like the rest of you. A majority of us came here to learn about business so that we can try to do good and make a difference in the world in the ways that we can - is that so bad?"
[.C]
"Lol "make a difference" yeah all that profit for shareholders is so important to humanity"

"I was in my friend's room when I asked him what he was dressing up as for Halloween. He pulls out all of his Stern branded things: water bottle, shirt, hoodie, duffle bag, hat and a couple of stickers. Me: 'you're going as a Sternie?' Him: 'Nah an obnoxious prick'"

"To the OP who anonymously sent in a secret last night about a professor who allegedly sexually harassed multiple students who tried reporting it twice to no avail - I just got off the phone with the president's office and a few other people in an attempt to report it. If you feel comfortable, please DM the page for details. Let me know if you have any questions, or if there's anything else I can do to help you. Thanks."

"A random drunk girl climbed in through my open window from my fire escape and asked if she could use my bathroom. Keep in mind that I was ass naked at the time and my fuck buddy was balls deep inside me. She did ask how the sex was, which was nice."

"You should show some hospitality and ask her to join. In those religious text she could be a real goddess disguised as a drunk girl."

"My quiet, religiously conservative roommate got a girlfriend a few weeks ago. They hang out in our room a lot which is fine, they're pretty chill, and the first time he asked about her staying over I thought nothing of it, having heard his spiel about his faith and devotion to celibacy until marriage. Fast forward to last night when I wake up at 3am to take a piss, and hear creaking bedsprings and muffled, awkward moans from 5 feet away. Never in my life have I wished harder for a Polaroid camera, because I would've framed the look of sheer horror in his moonlit eyes."

"Am I the only one who thinks the new security guard at Bobst is super hot? He stands on the left side of the lobby in the morning/ early afternoon looking so damn fine in his uniform, and he’s always got that serious ‘I ain’t letting anyone in this god damn library without their NYU ID card’ face. Now I only enter Bobst from the left side in the morning/afternoon just so I can make eye contact with him."

"I've been dating a girl for almost two years now. I'm a mixed-race POC and she's aryan as fuck. Today, after acting oddly standoffish and squeamish for a few months, she left me, saying that she just couldn't date someone who was non white anymore, because apparently there are things POC can't understand. I'm livid and heartbroken and entirely disappointed. I really thought I was going to spend my life with this girl, and over the span of a few months, she turns into a white nationalist. Why does it take so long for some people's true colors to come out?"
[.C]
"Sounds like you're better off without her. She sounds like a terrible human being at heart and her true colors emerged. I hope you find someone more deserving of your affection"

"Being celibate in this school (and college in general) has been rougher than I anticipated. My friends constantly base conversations on sex stories, and I can't do much else other than nod and smile. People either tease me or respect me for keeping my virginity. Experiences on dating apps haven't been the best, since delayed sex or no sex doesn't sit well with most people. It's come to the point where I don't even want to bother with dating anymore. This isn't a knock on sexually-active people -- all the power to y'all. I don't plan on changing my stance, but I can't help but feeling like an outsider, socially and romantically."

"When I was in high school I was really into God and saving myself for marriage (which is odd because gay marriage wasn't even legal yet) and I called myself the celibacy queen"

"Last semester my professor told us during our second to last class that we need to email our final papers to her as class is cancelled because she is having her baby. We all were soooo shook and literally thought she was joking. Plot twist, she was pregnant the entire time. I was sipping the coffee that made me late (meme reference) and actually choked on it. The class tried to backtrack and act like we knew, but it we were too far gone. She literally said, “I can’t believe you guys thought I was just fat.” Sis tried to play it off, but when she was grading our final papers she definitely took each of our reactions into account. Moral of the story is: if a professor is making an announcement, put all liquids down."[.C]

"Could we have feast on weekends? "

"you can thank the people who voted for rendezvous instead, thus ruining my following weekends in my last year in the dorms, which was 2015. I used to go to feast every weekend for dim sum. had to have rendezvous SAD alternative. I'm still salty about it bc it fucked up the rest of that year's meals for me"
